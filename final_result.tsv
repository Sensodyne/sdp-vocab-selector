operation	"Saudi Arabia-headquartered utilities company Acwa Power, which features the kingdom’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) as its majority stakeholder, said commercial operations have begun at its 485-megawatt (MW) Zarqa independent power plant (IPP) in Jordan.

The plant has been constructed to support the Jordan Vision 2025 and the National Energy Strategy programmes to drive power infrastructure projects in the country.

Acwa Power is the project's developer, alongside Jordan government-backed Samra Electric Power Company's unit, Sepco III Electric Power Construction Co, which acted as engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor.

According to a statement on the New York Stock Exchange-listed GE’s website, the company's power business has supplied three 9E heavy-duty gas turbines for the Zarqa IPP under an agreement that was inked in September 2016.

In addition to the gas turbines, the plant comprises three heat recovery steam generators (HRSG) and one steam gas turbine generator, along with six stacks, one for each gas turbine and HRSG.

Jordan’s National Electric Power Company (Nepco) has supplied a new gas pipeline connecting the project with Jordan’s main gas pipeline.

Operations commenced on 29 September, 2018, and when it reaches peak production, the plant will supply enough electricity to power 350,000 homes in Jordan.

The plant has been built with a capacity to operate 51% of combined cycle efficiency, making it Jordan’s most efficient thermal power plant. Simultaneously, it will consume less fuel and release fewer emissions per megawatt-hour of the total electricity generated.

Commenting on the plant's construction completion, Paddy Padmanathan, president and chief executive officer of Acwa Power, said: “The completion of construction and commencement of operations of the Acwa Power Zarqa plant represents our pragmatic approach to serving the power needs of growing countries and communities while increasing efficiency and delivering power at low cost.”

Padmanathan said the project will deliver electricity at ‘one of the lowest tariffs’ in Jordan.

Mohamad Ali, president and chief executive officer of GE’s gas power systems – projects business in the Middle East, Pakistan, and India, added: “GE’s 9E gas turbines can operate reliably and efficiently in extreme conditions such as Jordan’s desert heat and offers tremendous versatility and fuel flexibility, capable of running on more than 50 different kinds of fuels resulting in lower costs of power production.”

Jordan aims at driving more investments in its public and private projects to bolster domestic energy generation by 40% by 2020, and Acwa Power’s Zarqa IPP brings the Arab nation closer to its target."	https://www.constructionweekonline.com/projects-tenders/180704-operations-begin-on-acwa-powers-485-mw-zarqa-ipp-in-jordan

The Acwa Power Zarqa combined cycle power plant can generate the equivalent electricity needed to supply up to 350,000 Jordanian households and is the most efficient thermal power plant in Jordan, said a statement from the Saudi company.

It is capable of operating at over 51 per cent combined cycle efficiency, leading to lower fuel consumption and fewer emissions per megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity generated.

The Acwa Power Zarqa IPP supports Jordan’s Vision 2025 to boost economic growth and the Master Strategy of the Energy Sector of Jordan (National Energy Strategy) to drive stronger investments in private and public power projects to boost domestic energy generation by 40 per cent by 2020.

Acwa Power President and CEO Paddy Padmanathan said: ""We are delighted to announce the launch of Zarqa CCGT plant, which reaffirms our commitment and contribution to the Jordanian power sector, economy, and social development.""

""The completion of construction and commencement of operations of the plant represents our pragmatic approach to serving the power needs of growing countries and communities while increasing efficiency and delivering power at low cost,"" observed Padmanathan.

""The fact that this project is capable of delivering electricity at one of the lowest tariffs in the country is a source of great pride to us,"" he added.

The Zarqa plant has deployed three of its 9E gas turbines following a deal executed in September 2016 with Acwa Power and SepcoIII Electric Power Construction Company, which is the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractor.

""GE has supported the development of Jordan’s power sector for almost 40 years, with advanced solutions that bring high levels of operational efficiency and productivity,"" remarked Mohamad Ali, the president and CEO of GE's Gas Power Systems (projects business) for the Middle East, India and Pakistan.

""GE’s 9E gas turbines are an excellent fit for Jordan as they operate reliably and efficiently in extreme conditions such as desert heat and offer tremendous versatility and fuel flexibility, capable of running on more than 50 different kinds of fuels, thus allowing Nepco to utilise more economical fuels and leading to lower costs of power production,"" he added.

Located to the north-east of Zarqa city, the project is constructed next to the decommissioned Hussein Thermal Power Station (HTPS).

GE Power said it has a strong footprint in Jordan, having also signed a multi-year services agreement with Samra Electric Power Company (Sepco) for full-plant maintenance services, including parts and repairs for critical power generation equipment for the 1,175 MW Samra Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) Power Plant in the Zarqa region, which feeds power into the national grid for both residential and commercial use.

The agreement covers seven GE gas turbines that are installed and operating at the Samra Station, it stated.

The new $817M power station, which includes two electricity producing power blocks with four generators and more than 18K components, generates enough energy to serve 450K homes.

Duke says the Asheville station is its most efficient plant in the Carolinas, and 75% more efficient than the retired coal plant it replaced, while carbon emissions at the site have fallen 60% per Mwh compared with the retired plant.

Duke recently started commercial operations at its 200 MW Holstein solar energy project in Texas, the largest solar project in the company's fleet."	https://seekingalpha.com/news/3593804-new-duke-energy-gas-plant-providing-energy-for-450k-homes
operation	"A two-unit, combined-cycle gas-turbine (CCGT) station built to replace an older coal-fired power plant is now fully operational and delivering electricity for Duke Energy’s customers in North Carolina and South Carolina.

The new Asheville station in Arden, N.C. is deemed to be 75 percent more efficient than the 1960s-era coal-fired plant which was shut down in January. Demolition of the Asheville coal-fired site is underway and expected to be finished by 2023.

“Customers want cleaner, more reliable energy, and we’re committed to delivering on this expectation,” said Kevin Murray, Duke vice president of project management and construction. “By building the new Asheville station, we’re significantly reducing air emissions – including carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides – and continuing to move toward our companywide goal of cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 50 percent by 2030.”

The Ashville combined cycle station cost about $817 million to build. The first 280-MW unit came online in December 2019, while the second 280-MW power block went into commercial operation in April.

Carbon dioxide emissions at the site have dropped by about 60 percent per MWh in comparison to the now-retired coal plant, according to Duke Energy. Sulfur dioxide is expected to decrease by 99 percent and nitrogen oxides by 40 percent. Mercury has also been eliminated.

Duke has committed $1.4 billion in capital expenditures to provide power with lower emissions in the Asheville region. The utility is spending $175 million on upgrading transmission lines, substations and some undergrounding of distribution lines.

A 17-MW battery storage system will be built at the Asheville site, while Duke also plans to invest in a 10-MW solar plant. The renewables side of the Asheville plan will cost close to $120 million.

Some environmental and advocacy groups opposed Duke’s CCGT station early on, but the project won state and federal approval by 2017.

The Asheville units use combustion turbines and generators with bypass stacks. These allow the combustion turbines to operate when the heat recovery steam generator or steam turbine generator are offline for maintenance work.

The station can also burn diesel if natural gas is unavailable.

Hot commissioning of Wheelabrator’s Kemsley energy from waste facility in Kent is underway using waste supplied by Suez recycling and recovery UK.

And, Suez is understood to have won a major ongoing contract to supply the plant with waste as a feedstock. The award is expected to give Suez the opportunity to potentially almost cease the export of refuse derived fuel (RDF) from the UK and so allow it to handle all waste domestically, apart from Scotland.

Last year Suez sent just under 300,000 tonnes of waste abroad for energy recovery as RDF. However, its exports in the first quarter of this year were down by about 25% at approx. 72,000 tonnes compared to 106,000 tonnes in 2019 (overall RDF exports in this period in England were down around 30%).

Heat

Besides generating 44MW (net) of renewable baseload energy electricity, Wheelabrator Kemsley is also a notable project because of the heat usage which will be by the neighbouring DS Smith Kemsley paper mill.

Wheelabrator Kemsley explains that the facility consists of two 35 tonnes per hour lines and that it will annually process up to 550,000 tonnes of non-recyclable waste. The site will generate 180GWh of heat which will be used to supply steam to the paper mill which has been operating at Kemsley since 1924.

Construction of the Kemsley energy from waste plant started in 2016 and is on target for the handing over from the commissioning stage to commercial operations this summer.

Wheelabrator has rapidly developed its offering in the UK with the Kemsley plant part of its portfolio and it is thought to now be the fourth largest operator. The business is headquartered in the US where most of its facilities are on the east coast. Apart from Kemsley its projects in the UK include two facilities at its giant Ferrybridge EfW site which is run in partnership with SSE. With SSE, Wheelabrator is also planning the development of a facility at Skelton Grange, Leeds.

Suez EfW

Suez is also increasing its own energy from waste capacity in the UK.

Among its projects are: a 55,000 tonnes gasification plant in Surrey due to be operational this year; the expansion of the Suffolk EfW plant by 26,000 tonnes; approval for a 500,000 tonne facility in Blackburn; a new plant is to be operational in 2022 at Billingham for 240,000 tonnes of waste; and plans to increase the throughput of the Severnside facility in Gloucestershire by 100,000 tonnes. Suez’ other facilities include Teesside, Redcar, Kirklees, Isle of Man and Cornwall.

Work on the Surrey gasification plant was paused in mid-March because of the coronavirus pandemic but resumed again last week and commissioning tests are also to restart."	https://www.letsrecycle.com/news/latest-news/suez-secures-order-for-kemsley-efw-facility/

Global Wind Installations Fall as Market Dynamics Shake Up Sector

The Global Wind Energy Council’s (GWEC’s) April 3-released annual report notes 51.3 GW of new wind capacity was installed worldwide in 2018, bringing total cumulative installations up to 591 GW. In the onshore market, 46.8 GW was installed, a decrease of 4.3% compared to 2017. China and the U.S. remained the largest onshore markets, adding 21.2 GW and 7.6 GW of new capacity, respectively. The European onshore market installed 9 GW, a notable 32% decrease compared to 2017. GWEC expects the onshore market to install more than 50 GW per year until 2023. “Mature markets in Asia, Europe and North America will continue with stable volumes. Growth will come from developing wind energy markets in Africa/Middle East, Latin America and South-East Asia,” it said. The offshore wind market remained stable in 2018 with 4.5 GW of new additions, bringing cumulative installations to 23 GW. Future growth is anticipated in Asia and in North America, GWEC said.

Japan Ministry Suggests It Will Block New Coal Plants

Japan’s Environment Ministry in a policy initiative on March 28 said it will evaluate environmental impact statements for new coal-fired power plants more strictly, and, in principle, it will not approve construction of new large coal-fired power plants or coal-fired boiler upgrades at existing facilities. Decisions by the ministry, which conducts environmental impact assessments for new plants with an output capacity of 150 MW or more, are considered by the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry, which has final say on whether to approve new coal plant projects, and which forecasts a dominant 26% role for coal in the country’s power mix in 2030. According to the Institute of Energy Economics, Japan (IEEJ), coal power plants produced 30% of the country’s power in fiscal year 2018, a share that it expects will remain stable this year. The bulk of Japan’s power in 2018 was produced by liquefied natural gas (40%). IEEJ in December forecast that oil-fired power generation, which produced 5% of Japan’s power in 2018, is set to see a marked decline as more than 13 GW is subjected to idling or retirement in 2019. In 2018, nuclear produced 6%, hydro supplied 10%, and other renewables provided 9%. ■

operation	"Wheelabrator’s new 550,000 tonne per year Kemsley waste to energy plant has opened for commercial operations in Kent following a commissioning phase through the early 2020.

Wheelabrator Kemsley is now operational as a combined heat and power facility and will generate up to 49.9 MW (gross) / 44 MW (net) of baseload electricity for the grid.

The facility will process up to 550,000 tonnes of non-recyclable waste from across Kent and the South East. However planning permission for additional waste capacity and electrical output is pending approval.

The facility will play a major role in reducing waste sent to landfill or for European export, saving carbon emissions when compared with sending the waste to landfill and making better use of non-recyclable material in the UK through the energy recovery process. It will also provide valuable steam heat – up to 70 tonnes per hour – to DS Smith’s adjacent Kemsley Paper Mill, helping to diversify its energy requirements.

Wheelabrator Technologies, the largest pure play waste to energy platform and fourth largest waste to energy business in the UK, will process 2.2 million tonnes of non-recyclable household and commercial waste each year, in turn generating 1.1 net MWh of baseload energy, enough to power around 500,000 UK homes and businesses. The portfolio of four strategically located assets includes:

Wheelabrator Parc Adfer at Deeside in North Wales, processing 200,000 tonnes of non-recyclable waste to generate 19 MW (gross) / 17 MW (net) per year

Multifuel Energy Limited Ferrybridge 1 in Yorkshire, processing 725,000 tonnes of non-recyclable waste to generate 79 MW (gross) 72 MW (net) per year (under a joint venture with SSE).

Multifuel Energy Limited Ferrybridge 2 – also in Yorkshire, processing 675,000 tonnes of non-recyclable waste to generate 79 MW (gross) / 72 MW (net) per year (under a joint venture with SSE).

Wheelabrator Kemsley was built by EPC contractor CNIM, and in the four years of construction over 800 jobs were created, including 46 full time operational roles, and significant inward investment across the region was generated as a result of construction.

The company aid that with a strong focus on safety, there have been more than four million man hours without a single lost time incident and commissioning during early 2020 was completed carefully in-line with UK Government COVID-19 safety and social distancing guidance.

Robert Boucher, President and CEO at Wheelabrator Technologies, said: “To be able to complete construction, hot commissioning, grid synchronization and steam export to DS Smith during the COVID-19 pandemic is a fantastic accomplishment and a testament to the commitment of our team and our partners to work safely and Make a Difference. Takeover at Kemsley is the result of many years of commitment, hard work and strong partnerships with DS Smith, our customers and the communities we operate within.”

Colin McIntyre, CEO of DS Smith’s Paper and Recycling divisions added:

“Harvesting steam from Wheelabrator Technologies facility for our paper mill at Kemsley is a key part of our energy strategy. As the largest mill for recycled paper in the UK, processing almost 1 million tonnes of paper for recycling a year, achieving the right energy mix is vital. With the facility fully operationally, it will supply us with a third of the steam required to run our paper making operations.”

We are delighted with our strategic energy partnership with Wheelabrator, a partnership which enables a carbon reduction of 78,000 tonnes per year and contributes to one of our nine ambitious long-term sustainability targets – to reduce our CO2e emissions by 30 per cent per tonne of production by 2030.”

Upgrade

While Wheelabrator Kemsley is now in full commercial operation, a Development Consent Order (DCO) application was submitted to the Planning Inspectorate in 2019 to upgrade the energy output the facility and increase the waste throughput. If granted, the DCO approval would allow Wheelabrator to increase the output of the facility up to 75 MW (gross) / 66 MW (net) and process up to 657,000 tonnes. A decision on the application is expected in Q1 2021.

Wheelabrator’s DCO application also contains plans for Wheelabrator Kemsley North, which is a proposed waste to energy facility which would be located on land immediately adjacent to Wheelabrator Kemsley.

Wheelabrator Kemsley North would be a new single line waste to energy facility capable of generating up to 42 MW (gross) / 37 MW (net) of renewable baseload energy by processing up to 390,000 tonnes of non-recyclable waste each year. Together, both Kemsley facilities would generate enough energy to power more than 240,000 UK homes and businesses

The company also has a further series of advanced waste to energy projects in development in the UK including:"	https://waste-management-world.com/a/550-000-tpa-wheelabrator-waste-to-energy-plant-enters-commercial-service-in-kent-uk
operation	"Duke Energy Progress, the Duke Energy subsidiary that serves about 1.6 million customers in the Carolinas, announced the completion of its new Asheville Combined Cycle Station in Arden, North Carolina.

The company said the $817 million combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) facility (Figure 1) includes two power blocks with a total of four generators and more than 18,000 components. The first 280-MW unit came online in December 2019, and the second similar unit became fully operational in April.

1. The Asheville Combined Cycle Station is a two-unit facility with a total capacity of 560 MW. The units are designed with bypass stacks, which allow the combustion turbines to continue producing energy when their associated heat recovery steam generator or steam turbine generator is offline for maintenance. The station will normally run on natural gas, but can also burn diesel fuel when necessary. Courtesy: Duke Energy

In late January, Duke Energy retired a 1960s-era coal-fired unit at the Asheville site. Demolition of that plant is underway, with completion expected in 2023. The company said emissions from the site have declined significantly as a result of the transition from coal to natural gas. SO 2 is expected to decrease by 99%, NO x by 40%, CO 2 by 60%, and mercury has been completely eliminated.

“Customers want cleaner, more reliable energy, and we’re committed to delivering on this expectation,” Kevin Murray, Duke Energy’s vice president of project management and construction, said in a statement. “By building the new Asheville station, we’re significantly reducing air emissions—including carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides—and continuing to move toward our companywide goal of cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 50% by 2030.”

The Asheville Combined Cycle Station is said to be Duke Energy’s most efficient plant in the Carolinas. The company claims it’s 75% more efficient than the retired coal plant it replaced. It also requires less manpower to operate. Only about 30 employees—many of whom had previously worked at the retired coal plant—are needed to operate and maintain the facility.

Duke Energy said it is investing in several other projects in the Asheville region. The company will build a 9-MW to 10-MW solar plant and a 17-MW to 18-MW battery storage facility at the Asheville station after the coal plant is demolished. It’s also connecting a 9-MW lithium-ion battery facility to the Rock Hill substation in the city of Asheville.

Power lines, electrical substations, and other infrastructure to get power from plants to customers in western North Carolina have also been upgraded, and a microgrid including a 2-MW solar installation and a 4-MW lithium-ion battery storage system was approved last May for construction in Hot Springs. Duke Energy said the infrastructure upgrades and renewable energy investments together totaled more than $295 million.

operation	"The amount of waste wood processed in the UK has increased by six per cent to 3.98 million tonnes in 2019, according to new figures from a survey by the Wood Recyclers Association (WRA).

The figures, released yesterday (23 June), show that the amount of waste wood processed increased from 3.75 million tonnes in 2018, continuing the year-on-year rise that has seen a significant increase in waste wood processed from 2.8 million tonnes in 2011.

The newly released statistics also show that waste wood to be converted into Chapter IV biomass – biomass feedstocks that are burned for energy – rose by almost 14 per cent, to 2.39 million tonnes last year. The amount of waste wood processed into small-scale biomass also increased by 39 per cent across the UK.

Additionally, exports of waste wood across the UK fell steeply by 39 per cent from 313,000 tonnes in 2018 to 190,00 tonnes in 2019.

Julia Turner, Executive Director of the WRA, said: “We hope that such a healthy end to 2019 will stand us in good stead for surviving the impact of Covid-19, and are thrilled to see that with an estimated 4.5 million tonnes of waste wood available in the UK, so much of it is now being recycled or reprocessed.”

The total figures for the UK waste wood sector as a whole are based on responses from members of the WRA, which represents 90 per cent of the UK wood recycling sector. This year’s survey showed that WRA members processed more than 3.5 million tonnes of waste wood, an increase of 4.3 per cent from 2018.

The latest figures were also significant for the decrease of waste wood being processed into animal bedding, equine surfaces and other recycled products, which fell by 18 per cent across the UK, while the amount of waste wood processed by the panel and board industry rose by 12 per cent.

Turner added: “We suspect there is a correlation between the decrease in waste wood being

processed into animal bedding and the increase into panel board and small scale biomass, as both of these use Grade A packaging materials.

“We are also seeing a realisation of imports of waste wood starting and estimate around 20,000 tonnes came into the UK last year. We expect that to continue to grow this year.”

Long road ahead

Despite the promising figures for wood recycling last year, however, the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic has put the waste wood sector in an uncertain position, with waste wood industry experts predicting a long and difficult recovery from the pandemic. One of the main contributing factors to this difficulty is the closure of Household Waste and Recycling Centres (HWRCs) across the UK, meaning wood recycling centres are suffering from a shortage of wood to process or recycle.

At a recent webinar organised by the WRA and the Chartered Institution of Wastes Management (CIWM), waste wood experts discussed the challenges the industry faces in the months to come. Among the issues addressed was the significantly reduced demand for panel boards, with a considerably slow return to normality expected for the sector and the industry as a whole.



Speaking at the webinar, Vicki Hughes of Enva Wood Recycling predicted there could be a shortage of waste wood for processing of at least 400,000 tonnes over the next 12-18 months."	https://resource.co/article/waste-wood-processing-rises-six-cent-2019

operation	"A new energy-from-waste (EfW) facility in Kent, Wheelabroator Kemsley, has entered full commercial operation following a successful commissioning phase in early 2020.

Operated by Wheelabrator Technologies, the new facility is a combined heat and power facility that will generate up to 49.9 megawatts (MW) of electricity with the capacity to process 550,000 tonnes of non-recyclable waste every year.

Wheelabrator Kemsley was built by contractor CNIM, creating 800 jobs over four years of construction, including 46 full-time operational roles, with significant inward investment in the region around the facility.

The new facility brings Wheelabrator Technologies’ total residual waste treatment capacity in the UK to 2.2 million tonnes, generating a net 1.1 megawatt hours (MWh) of energy for the UK grid, enough to power 500,000 homes and businesses every year.

Wheelabrator Technologies’ other UK facilities include Wheelabrator Parc Adfer in Deeside in north Wales (200,000 tonnes of waste per year), Multifuel Energy Limited Ferrybridge 1 in Yorkshire (725,000 tonnes) and Multifuel Energy Limited Ferrybridge 2 in Yorkshire (675,000 tonnes).

The new facility adds a significant amount of additional residual waste treatment capacity to the UK’s current overall capacity at a time when industry and policy-makers are calling for more EfW plants to deal with the UK’s growing levels of residual waste.

A new report from UK think tank Policy Connect has called for widespread deployment of EfW facilities in a “Scandinavian” approach, naming EfW technology as the ‘safest, cheapest and most environmentally responsible solution to the UK’s residual waste problem’ as the UK looks to continue its move away from landfill.

Wheelabrator Kemsley EfW facility

Concerns have been raised, however, over the emissions produced by EfW plants and the health impacts of living close to these incinerators , while MPs have called for an incineration tax to promote investment in recycling rather than locking in waste treatment in EfW facilities.

Robert Boucher, President and CEO at Wheelabrator Technologies, said: “To be able to complete construction, hot commissioning, grid synchronization and steam export to DS Smith during the Covid-19 pandemic is a fantastic accomplishment and a testament to the commitment of our team and our partners to work safely and make a difference. Takeover at Kemsley is the result of many years of commitment, hard work and strong partnerships with DS Smith, our customers and the communities we operate within.”



Wheelabrator Kemsley will also provide steam heat – up to 70 tonnes per hour – to fibre-based packaging company DS Smith’s adjacent Kemsley Paper Mill.

Colin McIntyre, CEO of DS Smith’s Paper and Recycling divisions, said: “Harvesting steam from Wheelabrator Technologies’ facility for our paper mill at Kemsley is a key part of our energy strategy. As the largest mill for recycled paper in the UK, processing almost one million tonnes of paper for recycling a year, achieving the right energy mix is vital. With the facility fully operationally, it will supply us with a third of the steam required to run our paper making operations.

Wheelabrator Technologies submitted a Development Consent Order (DCO) application in 2019 to increase the Kemsley facility’s energy output and increase the waste capacity to 75 MW and 657,000 tonnes respectively, with a decision expected in the first three months of 2021.

Wheelabrator is also working on three new facilities expected to commence construction in 2021: Wheelabrator Kemsley North (390,000 tonnes of non-recyclable waste per year), Wheelabrator Kelvin in West Bromwich (400,000 tonnes of non-recyclable waste per year) and Multifuel Skelton Grange in Yorkshire (410,000 tonnes of non-recyclable waste per year), developed in collaboration with SSE as part of the Multifuel Energy Limited 2 joint venture.

One project that won’t be going ahead is Wheelabrator’s proposed 500,000-tonne capacity facility in Hampshire’s Test Valley, after Wheelabrator Technologies announced it would be withdrawing plans in February this year after two public consultations revealed the extent of local opposition to the project."	https://resource.co/article/wheelabrator-kemsley-efw-plant-enters-full-operation

operation	"Candu Energy will work on upgrades to extend the operating life of a 24-year-old Romanian nuclear power unit.

Candu, a member of the SNC-Lavalin Group, was awarded a $10.8 million contract by Societatea Nationala Nuclearelectrica S.A. (SNN) for engineering analysis and assessments on the Cernavoda Unit 1 CANDU nuclear reactor. The contract is focused on the fuel channel and feeders assemblies with the objective of extending the operating life of the plant by approximately 4 years, up to 245,000 effective full power hours (EFPH) from the original design life of 210,000 EFPH.

This extensions would enable the Cernavoda plant to operate safely until it is ready for refurbishment in 2026.

In October, SNN had also awarded SNC-Lavalin and its partner Ansaldo Nucleare the condition assessment work which will determine the scope of repair and replacement of other equipment as part of the Cernavoda Unit 1 refurbishment outage.

“SNC-Lavalin looks forward to continuing our long relationship with SNN to optimize the operation of Cernavoda Unit 1 in preparation for a refurbishment that will contribute to over 60 years of CANDU reactor life,” said Sandy Taylor, President, Nuclear, SNC-Lavalin. “Our dedicated project execution team has exceptional expertise in this area, having completed similar assessments for several CANDU clients around the world.”

Cernavoda Unit 1 produces over 700 MW of electricity, about 10 percent of Romania’s electricity demands. It was commissioned and began commercial full power operation in December 1996.

Nuclear power units do not emit carbon dioxide. Officials estimate that Cernavoda Unit 1 has avoided the release of more than four million metric tonnes of CO2 annually that would have been produced by a coal-fired plant, according to the release.

CANDU, known as Canada Deuterium Uranium, was invented in Canada. It uses deuterium oxide as a moderator and uranium as a fuel, according to the Canadian Nuclear Association.

The CANDU reactor also has been used at the Bruce, Darlington and Pickering power plants.

operation	"An International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) team of experts today completed a review of long term operational safety at the Cernavoda Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) in Romania.

The Pre-SALTO (Safety Aspects of Long Term Operation) review mission was requested by the plant’s operator, Societatea Nationala Nuclearelectrica SA.

Cernavoda NPP is the only nuclear power plant in Romania and consists of two 650-MWe pressurized heavy-water reactors. Unit 1 went into commercial operation in 1996 and Unit 2 in 2007. The 11-member SALTO team focused on aspects essential to the safe Long Term Operation (LTO) of Unit 1, which Nuclearelectrica plans to extend for a total operational lifetime of approximately 60 years.

During the 11-19 February mission, the SALTO team reviewed preparedness, organization and programmes related to LTO. SALTO reviews are based on IAEA safety standards.

The review team found staff at the plant to be professional, open and receptive to suggestions for improvement.

“The team observed that the operator is implementing preparations for safe LTO in a timely manner,” said team leader and IAEA Senior Nuclear Safety Officer Robert Krivanek. “Some ageing management and LTO activities already meet IAEA safety standards, and the SALTO team encourages the plant to address the review findings and facilitate implementation of all remaining activities for safe LTO.”

The team—comprising experts from Argentina, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands and Sweden, and two IAEA staff members—identified good practices and good performances that will be shared with the nuclear industry globally, including:

The plant makes effective use of international experience shared in the CANDU Owners Group for safety improvements.

The plant successfully applies a long term corrective action programme.

The plant uses a dynamic learning approach for work not performed on a regular basis.

The team also provided recommendations to further enhance preparations for LTO safety:

The plant should improve its LTO strategy to cover all necessary activities to prepare for safe LTO.

The plant should develop and implement a comprehensive methodology to set the scope for structures and components as part of ageing management and LTO.

The plant should perform an adequate ageing management review for LTO.

“We appreciate the IAEA support to our plant in ageing management and preparation for safe LTO,” said Dan Bigu, Cernavoda NPP site director. “The results of this mission will help us to improve our activities for safe LTO and to further align them with IAEA safety standards.”

The plant management expressed a determination to address the areas identified for improvement and to continue cooperation with the IAEA in preparation for safe LTO.

The team provided a draft report to the plant management and to the National Commission for Nuclear Activities Control (CNCAN), the country’s nuclear regulatory authority, at the end of the mission. The plant management and CNCAN will have an opportunity to make factual comments on the draft. A final report will be submitted to the plant management, CNCAN and the Romanian Government within three months.

Background

General information about SALTO missions can be found on the IAEA Website. A SALTO peer review is a comprehensive safety review addressing strategy and key elements for the safe long term operation of nuclear power plants. They complement OSART missions, which are designed as a review of programmes and activities essential to operational safety. Neither SALTO nor OSART reviews are regulatory inspections, nor are they design reviews or substitutes for an exhaustive assessment of a plant's overall safety status.

LTO of nuclear power plants is defined as operation beyond an established time frame determined by the license term, the original plant design, relevant standards, or national regulations. As stated in IAEA safety standards, to maintain a plant’s fitness for service, consideration should be given to life limiting processes and features of systems, structures, and components (SSC), as well as to reasonably practicable safety upgrades to enhance the safety of the plant to a level approaching that of modern plants."	https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/pressreleases/iaea-concludes-long-term-operational-safety-review-of-romanias-cernavoda-nuclear-power-plant

GE said that Techint’s Norte III combined cycle power plant in Mexico has achieved the start of commercial operation using four GE 7F.04 gas turbines paired with four GE H33 generators and two steam turbines from Toshiba.

GE to operate, maintain facility

Under the terms of the agreement signed in 2018, GE will also operate and maintain the 907 MW plant, located in the municipality of Ciudad Juárez, in the state of Chihuahua, Mexico, for the next 25 years.

“We chose GE to collaborate with us on the Norte III plant because of its reliable technology and total plant-service solutions,” said Alejandro Maluf, CEO Techint North America. “We believe this important project will allow the consortium to leverage our collective global expertise in infrastructure, energy and project financing to support the expected growth in the Chihuahua region as was identified in the PRODESEN 2017-2030 plan.”

At the start of 2015, Mexico’s Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) commissioned the development of a combined cycle power plant just south of Ciudad Juarez in the State of Chihuahua, Mexico, to help meet the growing need for electricity in the region. The Chihuahua region was identified in the 15-year infrastructure development program for the enhancement of Mexico’s national electric system–PRODESEN 2017-2030—as a “deficient node,” given its expected growth in the next decade. The Norte III combined cycle plant will help to support this growth.

“We are proud that our gas turbine technology and total plant solutions including O&M services will help meet the growing electricity demand in Mexico, while offering capacity and efficiency guarantees tailored to meet Techint’s needs,” said Eric Gray, Vice President for Americas region, GE Gas Power. “The project was performed with the highest standards of quality and safety in crucial collaboration with FieldCore, the field services execution team owned by GE, providing productive and reliable results for our customers including Techint.”

As part of the 25-year operations agreement, GE will provide a full spectrum of digital solutions, including GE’s Asset Performance Management and Operations Optimization solutions to help predict and reduce unplanned downtime and improve power plant productivity. GE’s software will provide direct support to the GE O&M team in achieving the guaranteed capacity outcome.

GE has its third largest 7F gas turbine installed base in the world in Mexico, where GE began its operations in 1896. GE’s 16,000-square-meter Morelia Service Center, located in Morelia, Michoacán, Mexico, provides maintenance, testing and repair solutions for the Latin American region.

Celebrating 30 years

June marks the 30-year anniversary of GE’s 7F gas turbine technology. GE’s first 7F started commercial operation in 1990 and is still generating power today. The 7F technology is core to GE’s Gas Power portfolio of full life cycle products and services. Its installed base of 950+ units (including 96 in Latin America) generates 150 GW daily."	https://dieselgasturbine.com/907-mw-mexico-power-plant-starts-commercial-operation/
operation	"Canada’s SNC-Lavalin announced that it has been awarded two inspection contracts by Societatea Nationala Nuclearelectrica (SNN) during a planned outage of a unit at Nuclearelectrica’s Cernavoda nuclear power plant. The contracts, awarded to SNC Lavalin’s wholly-owned subsidiary Candu Energy Inc, cover fuel channel and feeder assembly inspections on the Cernavoda Unit 1 nuclear reactor during the 2020 outage.

These contract wins are aligned with the Company’s new strategy moving forward towards engineering services and greater growth.

“SNC-Lavalin is grateful for the opportunity to continue supporting SNN with the inspection of fuel channels in Cernavoda Unit 1 through our experienced team of trusted field services experts,” said Sandy Taylor, President, Nuclear, SNC-Lavalin.

“Our successful track record in delivering such services is the bedrock of our ongoing trusted relationship with SNN,” he added.

“We are looking forward to working with SNC-Lavalin for the periodic inspection of the fuel channel and feeder assembly of Cernavoda NPP Unit 1 during the 2020 outage,” said Cosmin Ghita, CEO, SNN.

“We have a very strong cooperation experience with great results and we are keen on having excellent engineering services to optimize our performance,” mentioned Cosmin Ghita.

Fuel channel inspections are part of periodic inspection activities of the Cernavoda Unit 1 reactor. Feeder assembly inspections involve SNC-Lavalin engineers and technicians performing ultrasonic inspection activities on major components.

Cernavoda Unit 1 produces over 700 MW of electricity, about 10 per cent of Romania’s electricity demands.

It was commissioned and began commercial full power operation in December 1996.

Since a nuclear plant does not emit greenhouse gases that contribute to acid rain and global warming, Unit 1 has avoided the release of more than four million tonnes per year of carbon dioxide (CO2) that would have been produced by a fossil fuel plant.

The CANDU power reactor offers a combination of proven and superior state-of-the-art technology. It was designed specifically for electricity production, unlike other major reactor types that evolved from other uses. This focused development is one of the reasons that CANDU has such high fuel efficiency.

CANDU 6 is Candu Energy’s 700 MWe class nuclear power reactor. The first CANDU 6 plants went into service in the early 1980s as leading-edge technology, and the design has continuously evolved since to maintain superior technology and performance.

It was licensed in the early 1980s in Canada, Argentina and the Republic of Korea. In 1996, Cernavoda Unit 1 was licensed in Romania, and Wolsong Unit 2 was licensed in Korea. Wolsong Units 3 and 4 were licensed in Korea in 1997 and 1999 respectively. Qinshan Units 1 and 2 were licensed in China in 2002 and 2003 respectively. In 2007, Cernavoda Unit 2 was licensed in Romania. These units came into service ahead of schedule and on budget. There are 11 operable CANDU 6 units."	https://energyindustryreview.com/power/snc-lavalin-awarded-inspection-contracts-for-cernavoda-unit-1/

Proprietary cleanup skid increases the volume of biogas usable for power generation

DANBURY, Conn., Dec. 30, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FuelCell Energy, Inc. (Nasdaq: FCEL), a global leader in delivering clean, innovative and affordable fuel cell solutions, recently announced the start of commercial operation of the 2.8 megawatt fuel cell project located at the city of Tulare, California’s waste water treatment facility. This milestone is the culmination of fifty years of innovation optimizing the application of SureSource power plants for power generation with on-site renewable fuels.

Using biogas began with the company’s very first commercial power plant shipment in 2003. That first 250 kW system operated on digester gas at a Kirin Brewery in Japan. A year later the company started the first prototype of today’s 1.4MW SureSource 1500 at the King County Wastewater Treatment plant in Renton, Washington. In subsequent years, the company has deployed over 20 MW of fuel cell systems operating on renewable biogas at wastewater treatment facilities agricultural facilities and breweries in California and around the world, leading up to the recently commissioned 2.8 MW Tulare project and the in-development 1.4 MW San Bernardino project.

FuelCell Energy’s continued focus on innovation led to a series of improvements in the gas cleaning and purification techniques the company uses to execute on-site biogas applications, leading to the best in class solution for clean power generation from this abundant and ever growing renewable resource. Some of the key advances developed through this extensive experience include the following:

Dual-fuel capability: In the first Kirin brewery application in 2003, the brewery did not make biogas on the weekends, and natural gas was not available. FuelCell Energy developed a feature that allowed its molten carbonate fuel cells to operate on propane during biogas outages. Now all FuelCell on-site biogas projects include a backup fuel capability, with the on-site biogas backed up by a secondary supply of natural gas or directed biogas.





Fuel-blending capability: At the King County facility, while consistent full power output was desired, the biogas production rate varied through the week. FuelCell Energy developed a feature that allowed its fuel cells to operate on any blend ratio of biogas and natural gas, keeping output at the plants level while biogas availability fluctuated. This fuel blending feature is now standard on FuelCell Energy’s platform and supports any project with varying biogas availability.





Improved gas cleanup: Biogas has approximately 60% of the energy content of natural gas due to dilution with carbon dioxide. Biogas includes impurities such as moisture and high levels of sulfur. The carbon dioxide dilution does not cause a problem for carbonate fuel cells as a result of unique properties of the carbonate electrochemistry, however the gas needs to be dried and the sulfur needs to be removed. Early projects used third-party suppliers for gas treatment systems, which suppliers used a variety of approaches based mostly on internal combustion engine experience. Some of those systems were ineffective or unreliable, and in some cases led to projects not meeting expectations due to fuel contamination. Realizing the need to leverage its own research and development expertise, FuelCell Energy developed in-house an improved, proprietary clean-up system. The first SureSource Treatment TM system has been operating flawlessly at the City of Riverside since September 2016, and will be a key element of all biogas projects going forward.





system has been operating flawlessly at the City of Riverside since September 2016, and will be a key element of all biogas projects going forward. Advanced Gas Monitoring: Sulfur cleanup is very important to fuel processing, and available technologies for continuously measuring sulfur concentration did not have the sensitivity or reliability needed to protect the fuel cell. FuelCell Energy developed a proprietary approach to sulfur detection exponentially more sensitive than anything available on the market. This technology has been operational at Riverside, was recently installed on the Tulare project, and will be a key part of all future projects.

These advances uniquely position FuelCell Energy to maintain a market leadership position and capture significant market share associated with the growing biogas power generation opportunity. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has previously estimated the potential for electricity generation from biogas in the United States is 4.7 GW, consisting of 0.6 GW wastewater, 2.6 GW landfill, and 1.5 GW agricultural1. The World Biogas Association estimates the global potential for wastewater and landfill gas opportunities to be 40 – 50 times that of the United States, and the agricultural potential more than 200 times.2 Only a fraction of this potential is currently being used for power generation, meaning that biogas methane is being vented or burned in flares, negatively impacting the environment. Widespread application of on-site biogas power production using the advanced technologies developed at FuelCell Energy can eliminate this waste and contribute to global decarbonization objectives.

FuelCell Energy Inc. announced the start of the fuel cell biogas project in California.

The Tulare biogas project, located in the Californian city Tulare, has begun commercial operation at the wastewater treatment facility. It is a 2.8-megawatt (MW) fuel cell project from Connecticut-based FuelCell Energy Inc., a company that prides itself on being a global leader in providing innovative, affordable and clean fuel cell solutions for the supply, recovery and storage of power.

The project is considered to be a milestone.

The Tulare biogas project is more than just a renewable power facility. According to the company’s press announcement it also supports the achievement of FuelCell Energy’s clean sustainability goals.

While biogas is a form of alternative energy and is created from biological waste, such as landfill waste, livestock waste, agricultural waste, etc., if not produced using technologies to prevent emissions, biogas is often considered to be a dirty renewable energy. The reason is it produces air pollution that is similar to natural gas, including greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions like carbon dioxide, methane and other pollutants.

That being said, the newly operational power plant in Tulare uses SureSource fuel cell and proprietary gas treatment systems to improve the reliability and efficiency of its renewable biogas applications.

The Tulare biogas project produces clean, renewable and carbon-neutral energy.

What makes the particular facility in Tulare unique is that it is fueled by the city’s biogas. This biogas is treated by the SureSource Treatments system. This is a cleanup technology created by FuelCell Energy for on-site biogas treatment.

With the fuel cell installed, the biogas no longer needs to be flared, a processe which wasted energy and generated GHG emissions. As such, the plant is able to use the city’s biogas and generate clean and renewable carbon-neutral power.

Additionally, the installed fuel cell system utilizes a natural chemical reaction versus a combustion approach to produce power, which dramatically lowers the NOx (nitrogen oxide), SOx (sulphur oxides), particulate matter and carbon emission profile in the San Joaquin Valley.

What’s more, the SureSource system will provide clean, renewable heat to the wastewater plant’s anaerobic digesters, providing even greater carbon emissions reductions and boosting sustainability.

“I am proud of our team for delivering the Tulare Biogas Project,” Jason Few, President and Chief Executive Officer, FuelCell Energy Globally, stated in the company PR. “Our solution delivers renewable and affordable power at a scale that is meaningful to communities and the utilities that serve them.”"	https://www.hydrogenfuelnews.com/unique-tulare-biogas-project-launches-into-commercial-operation/8539138/

operation	"Muscat, May 31 (ONA) --- Petroleum Development Oman’s (PDO) landmark 100-megawatt Amin Photovoltaic Power Plant has now achieved a key milestone with start of commercial operations, having been successfully commissioned three months ahead of schedule and passing the acceptance test procedures.

The Independent Power Producer (IPP) renewable energy project, located near Nimr which lies approximately 300km north east of Salalah, is providing power to PDO's Interior operations as one of the world's first utility scale solar projects to have an oil and gas company as the sole buyer of electricity.

The contract to develop, finance, build, operate and maintain the photovoltaic (PV) plant was awarded in January 2019 to Amin Renewable Energy Company S.A.O.C, a special purpose company founded and developed by the Marubeni Corporation (Japan) as the lead founder, Oman Gas Company S.A.O.C, Bahwan Renewable Energy Company LLC of Oman, Nebras Power QPSC (Qatar) and financed by Bank Muscat SAOG. The innovative project attracted competitive tenders from highly reputed global developers in the renewable energy industry.

Amin IPP is also the first utility scale PV power plant in Oman and has one of world’s lowest tariff at the time of award for such a project, which spans 23 years.

The installation was built and commissioned in record time, just under 12 months after signing the Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract, providing initial power into PDOs electrical grid in March 2020.

PDO Managing Director Raoul Restucci said: “Solar intensity in Oman provides an attractive platform to enable a lower carbon and more sustainable future and this flagship project is another building block in support of PDO’s continued transition to a fully-fledged energy company. The Amin power plant represents an excellent example of Oman's outstanding potential in renewable energy.

Restucci added “It is also a source of pride that Omani goods and services represented around a quarter of total project construction costs including site establishment, and local manufacturing and material supply and I am confident that the sector will continue to expand in Oman"".

He furthered, “Indeed, we look forward to continuing to make further progress in our plans to gradually increase the utilisation of renewable resources in our activities and are currently in the process of evaluating a number of exciting opportunities including wind power installations in our southern locations.”

The US$94 million facility in the south of the Sultanate covers an area of 4km2 and produces up to 100 megawatts of electricity directly from sunlight through solar panels. The generated energy is sufficient to power 15,000 homes, and could result in an annual CO2 emission reduction of more than 225,000 tonnes – the equivalent to taking 23,000 cars off the road.

President and CEO of Marubeni Middle East and Africa Power Limited Shunsuke Takahashi said: “This very important and first utility scale PV Solar project in Oman is a cornerstone to developing a more renewable based infrastructure in the country and Marubeni is very proud of being able to contribute to this strategic initiative together with our shareholding partners and PDO. The Amin project further underlines Marubeni’s strong desire to further expand its business activities in the power sector.”

Nebras Power CEO Khalid M. Jolo lauded the commercial operation of the facility saying: “The successful completion and inauguration of Amin IPP signifies the realisation of a commitment to deliver clean and reliable energy to the Sultanate of Oman that will serve as a dedicated source of power and further demonstrates the significant contribution and benefits of renewable energy.”

The environmentally beneficial project by using the electricity generated from solar power as an alternative to natural gas to support PDO operations is expected to provide an equivalent fuel saving of 95.5 million m3 of gas annually. The project has also successfully secured European Union carbon credit registration, helping to facilitate the implementation of PDO’s ambitious energy transition plans and pave the way for other opportunities to offset carbon dioxide emissions.

Reflecting the Sultanate’s ambitions to be at the forefront of the latest renewable energy developments, state-of-the-art technology has been utilised in the project including bifacial photovoltaic modules, which are the latest proven technology in the PV industry, and backtracking facilities to maximise the energy production over time.

operation	"A one-of-a-kind floating nuclear power plant, designed and built by Russia, has become the most northerly nuclear facility in the world, as it begins commercial operations in a remote region in the Arctic.

The Akademik Lomonosov, in a small town called Pevek in the far eastern region of Chukotka, is now fully commissioned, Russia’s nuclear agency Rosatom reported on Friday. The completion of the plant, which will provide energy for the remote area, was one of the corporation’s main goals for this year.

“Today we can consider the floating nuclear power plant construction project successfully completed…It officially becomes the 11th nuclear power plant in Russia and the northernmost one in the world,” said Andrei Petrov, director general of Rosenergoatom, Rosatom’s energy division, which was responsible for the project.

While the floating nuclear power plant had been supplying energy to local networks since the end of last year, the facility required some additional permissions to become fully operational. After inspections at the facility, the plant was proven to adhere to all state norms and regulations, including safety and environmental ones. It has received approval from Russia’s technical, nuclear and environmental watchdog and other environmental authorities.

“The unique characteristic of this plant is its multifunctionality: the ability to provide faraway isolated regions of our country with heat, electric energy, and drinking water to those regions where the deficit exists,” said Vitaly Trutnev, Rosatom’s construction director.

The new source of energy is extremely important for those living in the small Arctic town, as it will replace a coal power plant that had been providing Pevek with energy and heat for over 75 years. The facility polluted air in the area, with locals saying that they were worried about their children, as soot turned snow black and covered their windowsills.

“We hope that the situation improves and ecology will be better,” a local woman named Elena said. “[And] also that there’ll be more jobs, and new infrastructure will be developed.”

Since December, the Akademik Lomonosov has generated 47.3 million kWh of electricity, meeting around 20 percent of regional demand. It’s equipped with two KLT-40S icebreaker nuclear reactors, generating up to 70 megawatts of electricity and 50 gigacalories an hour of heat energy.

operation	"MAUBAN, Quezon—San Buenaventura Power Ltd. Co. (SBPL) inaugurated here the country’s first supercritical coal-fired power plant, providing Luzon 500 megawatts (MW) of additional capacity.

The P56.2-billion power plant started commercial operations last September 26, but was only formally inaugurated October 15.

Meralco PowerGen Corp. (MGen) President Rogelio Singson said in his speech that this is the country’s most advanced operational coal plant that utilizes a high-efficiency, low-emissions coal technology.

He explained that this technology can reduce carbon dioxide emissions and improve the efficiency of the power plant by producing more amount of energy with less coal.

“Significant advances in coal-fired power plant technology demonstrate that we do not have to choose between affordable and reliable electricity or a cleaner environment,” he said. “As a pioneer of this technology, SBPL is setting the bar higher in operating coal plants in the Philippines,” added the official.

The SBPL plant is a partnership between MGen and New Growth BV, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Electricity Generating Co. of Thailand (Egco).

Egco is the first independent power producer in Thailand. It has the state-owned Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand as a controlling shareholder.

MGen, on the other hand, is the power-generation subsidiary of Manila Electric Co. (Meralco)—the country’s largest electricity distributor.

The P56.2-billion power plant was partly funded by a P42.15-billion project finance facility—the Philippines’s largest all-peso transaction to date that was put together by a consortium of local banks.

It was built by the consortium of South Korea’s Daelim Industrial Co. Ltd. and Japan’s Mitsubishi Corp. which are both experienced engineering, procurement and construction contractors with very strong track records.

The ceremonial switch-on of the power plant was led by Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi, Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman Agnes VST Devanadera, Ambassador of Thailand to the Philippines Vasin Ruangprateepsaeng, Mauban Mayor Marita Llamas, and executives from Meralco and Egco Groups.

“The Philippine Electric Power industry welcomes the entry of new and emerging technologies, such as this supercritical power-generation technology which produces more efficient power generation while emitting less greenhouse gases. I am glad to take part in this inauguration of one of the most advanced and efficient plants in the country,” said Cusi.

For ERC’s part, Devanadera said SBPL’s power plant is “the response” to the country’s much needed additional power supply.

“No plant like this can ever go up without support of community,” she added."	https://businessmirror.com.ph/2019/10/16/p56-billion-phls-1st-supercritical-coal-fired-power-plant-switches-on-in-quezon/

operation	"MANILA Electric Co. (Meralco) has secured provisional authority from the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) to start operating San Buenaventura Power Ltd.’s (SBPL) 500-megawatt (MW) coal-fired power plant and provide baseload capacity to the Luzon grid.

“This is a welcome development, and one that shows that ERC understands that power demand in Luzon is steadily increasing, and the conditions show that we are in dire need of additional baseload capacity,” said Jose Ronald Valles, Meralco vice-president and head of regulatory management, in a statement.

He said the output from the power plant would be a “significant contributor” to Meralco in fulfilling its mandate to provide adequate, reliable supply of electricity at the least cost.

SBPL is led by Meralco subsidiary Meralco PowerGen Corp. (MGen), which earlier scheduled the country’s first supercritical coal-fired power plant in Mauban, Quezon to start operating this month.

The developer said its incoming capacity would prove “critical” in the coming months in light of the scheduled maintenance shutdown of Luzon’s biggest power generation suppliers. It said the Ilijan power plant’s first unit with 600 MW is set to go on planned maintenance for 13 days on Oct. 3-15, and curtail its capacity from Oct. 16-18.

SBPL also expects the Sual coal power plant’s unit two with 647 MW to shut down for 30 days from Oct. 19 to Nov. 17, while the San Lorenzo plant’s module 50 with 250 MW is scheduled to go on maintenance for five days on Oct. 26-30. Masinloc unit two with 344 MW will also be on scheduled outage for 35 days, beginning Oct. 30 to Dec. 4.

The scheduled outages come as the country’s biggest natural gas facility, Malampaya, will temporarily stop supplying fuel to generation facilities on Oct. 12-15. Malampaya supplies more than 40% of Meralco’s power requirement, and provides natural gas to fuel for Sta. Rita, San Lorenzo, Ilijan, San Gabriel and Avion power plants.

SBPL’s provisional authority to operate follows the statement by Energy Secretary Alfonso G. Cusi that his office had manifested to the ERC the importance of SBPL’s commissioning.

The plant’s commercial operation date was targeted on Sept. 15 but was deferred after the National Water Resources Board (NWRB) raised questions about SBPL’s use of water rights.

“We were able to provide adequate, factual answers immediately and NWRB responded also as promptly. Now, they are privy to the urgency of the power situation at hand, and hopefully gained new insights that will help them be more circumspect in their succeeding engagements within the power industry or beyond,” Mr. Valles said.

He said the ERC and the Department of Energy supervised “the quick resolution of the matter and thwart any further delays to the commissioning of SBPL and prevent a possible power supply problem in the Luzon grid.” — Victor V. Saulon

operation	"The first phase of the project, known as Sirius, is expected to generate 217 GWh of renewable energy and cut down on more than 180,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions annually. Image: Scatec Solar

Scatec Solar and its partners have both grid connected and reached commercial operation for the 86MW first phase of a 258MW PV installation in Upington, South Africa.

The first phase of the project, known as Sirius, is expected to generate 217 GWh of renewable energy and cut down on more than 180,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions annually.

Raymond Carlsen, CEO of Scatec Solar, said: “We are pleased to reach another milestone with the grid connection of our fourth solar power plant in South Africa, with a combined capacity of 276MW. South Africa continues to be a very important market for Scatec Solar, and we are developing several interesting project opportunities both within the utility scale segment as well as our container based solar solution – Release.”

The solar facility in Upington, which will be comprised of three total phases, was awarded back in April 2015 through the fourth bidding round of the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Programme (REIPP) in South Africa.

Ownership of the plant is split between Scatec Solar (42%), Norfund (18%), South African investor H1 Holdings (35%) and the surrounding community of Upington (5%).

The remaining two phases of the installation, featuring a combined installed capacity of 172MW, are expected to reach commercial operation over the next couple of months.

South Africa has continued to allocate more and more resources toward expanding its renewable-energy sector, especially thanks to a number of measures taken over the last couple of months.

Back in October 2019, the country’s Department of Mineral Resources and Energy (DMRE) signed off on a ruling to set aside 6GW of new large-scale solar over the next decade, with this new Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) allocating the capacity in 1GW instalments each year in 2022, 2023, 2025 and from 2028-30. South Africa had already committed solar allocations of 114MW in 2020, 300MW in 2021, and 400MW in 2022.

Just a month later, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and the national Department of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries announced a new scheme to add three Renewable Energy Development Zones (REDZs) to the initial eight areas identified in the country back in 2015.

Two new REDZs at Emalahleni and Klerksdorp will be used to fast-track PV resources, while a third zone mainly for wind was selected in Beaufort West. Projects located within these REDZs have to follow the more rapid Basic Assessment procedure instead of a full Scoping and Environmental Impact Assessment, while the timeframe for decision making by the environmental authorities is also reduced by 50 days."	https://www.pv-tech.org/news/scatec-solar-completes-first-phase-of-258mw-pv-project-in-south-africa
operation	"COAL TECHNOLOGY is getting cleaner and remains the most cost-efficient choice under current government policy on power generation, which is “technology neutral,” the head of a major power generating firm said.

Rogelio L. Singson, president and CEO of Meralco PowerGen Corp. (MGen) said the company’s next project will be a more efficient ultra-supercritical facility with lower emissions than the 500-megawatt (MW) plant it launched in Mauban, Quezon on Tuesday.

“Right now because the policy of the government is technology neutral… what is the cheapest baseload? Ang pinakamura (The cheapest) is still going to be coal,” he told reporters during the launch.

“We’re hoping that we will be able to build the next level, which is the ultra-supercritical [coal-fired power plant],” he said.

“Iyan ‘yung (That’s the) 1,200 MW that we bid for. Unfortunately, there was a failed bidding.”

He said he expects a second round of bidding, with MGen’s parent firm Manila Electric Co. (Meralco) holding a competitive selection process, or CSP, to arrive at the least-cost power for the distribution utility’s customers.

“So we will participate,” he said. “But having said that, we’re now going through an energy transition where we are committing to 1,000 to 1,200 MW of renewable [energy],” he said. “The problem that we are encountering is that we are facing transmission constraints.”

On Tuesday, MGen formally inaugurated the P56.2-billion San Buenaventura Power Ltd. Co. (SBPL), the country’s first supercritical coal-fired power plant, which now provides additional supply to the Luzon grid.

“The country’s most advanced operational coal plant uses a high-efficiency, low emissions (HELE) coal technology that allows the plant to operate at increasingly higher temperatures and pressures to reach higher efficiencies, while significantly reducing emissions,” the company said in a statement handed out during the launch.

“Similar and more advanced coal plant technologies have been the choice for new commercial coal-fired plants in many countries around the world. As a pioneer of this technology, SBPL is setting the bar higher in operating coal plants in the Philippines,” it added.

SBPL started commercial operations on Sept. 26, and currently generates power for Luzon, which accounts for about 72% of the country’s domestic output, it said. The plant’s cost was partly funded by a P42.15-billion project finance facility, which is said to be the Philippines’ largest all-peso transaction to date.

A consortium of Philippine banks put together the facility.

The power plant was built by a consortium of South Korea’s Daelim Industrial Co. Ltd. and Japan’s Mitsubishi Corp., which MGen described as “experienced engineering, procurement and construction contractors with very strong track records.”

The SBPL plant is a partnership between MGen, with a 51% stake, and New Growth BV, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Electricity Generating Company of Thailand (EGCO), the first independent power producer in Thailand. It has the state-owned Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) as a controlling shareholder.

“The more important thing is it’s a baseload [plant],” Mr. Singson said, referring to a facility that is always running to meet the base requirement of the power system. “We need baseload. Let’s not fool ourselves.”

During the launch, Energy Secretary Alfonso G. Cusi urged EGCO to invest more in power plant projects in the Philippines on its own since full foreign ownership is allowed.

“We want your investment,” he said.

Agnes VST Devanadera, chairman and chief executive officer of the Energy Regulatory Commission, said the plant has transformed the town of Mauban into a “very vibrant and very progressive community.”

“No plant like this can ever go up without the support of the community,” she said.

Meralco’s controlling stakeholder, Beacon Electric Asset Holdings, Inc., is partly owned by PLDT, Inc., Hastings Holdings, Inc., a unit of PLDT Beneficial Trust Fund subsidiary MediaQuest Holdings, Inc., has a majority stake in BusinessWorld through the Philippine Star Group, which it controls. — Victor V.

operation	"Kenya Launches Africa’s Largest Wind Farm. Kenya in July began operating the 310-MW Lake Turkana Wind Power (LTWP) facility, which the government said is Africa’s largest wind power farm. The LTWP project is a major part of the country’s goal of producing 100% renewable energy by 2020. The wind farm will increase Kenya’s electricity supply by 13%, according to Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta. The project is powered by the Turkana corridor wind, a low-level jet stream that originates in the Indian Ocean and blows year-round. An international consortium, including the African Development Bank, developed the $700 million project, which has 365 wind turbines. Around 70% of Kenya’s power comes from renewables, including hydropower and geothermal. State-owned power company KenGen produces about 80% of electricity consumed in Kenya and sells it to Kenya Power, the country’s main utility.

NRC Certifies Used Nuclear Fuel Transport Package. Holtec International reported that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) had certified the company’s HI-STAR 100MB transport package. Holtec expects the dual-purpose (capable of transport and on-site storage) and dual-use (capable of holding both unpackaged and canisterized fuel) cask to be a workhorse for transporting used nuclear fuel from nuclear plant sites around the country to its consolidated interim storage facility in southeastern New Mexico, which is currently under licensing, or directly to a repository. Earlier in August, Ukraine’s nuclear power plant operator Energoatom completed functional testing of Holtec’s HI-TRAC and HI-STAR 190 containers at Unit 3 of the Rovno nuclear power plant during the VVER-1000 reactor’s scheduled maintenance outage.

Croatia Solar Park Under Development. Croatian utility Hrvatska Elektroprivreda (HEP) in early August announced plans to build a 25-MW solar park in the area of the Kršan municipality, in the eastern part of the Istrian peninsula, near the site of HEP’s Plomin coal-fired power plant. HEP operates all of the country’s power plants, most of which are hydroelectric facilities. Plomin is the only coal-fired plant in Croatia, generating 210 MW from its single unit. A second, 125-MW unit ceased operation at the end of 2018. The solar park is among HEP’s first projects to develop renewable energy resources. Construction of the plant is set to begin in early 2021. Mayor Valdi Runko of the Kršan municipality said HEP is investing about 184 Croatian kuna (HRK) in the plant (about $27.6 million). HEP in April of this year announced an investment cycle of about $111 million by 2023 to build new solar power facilities. HEP has said it wants to install at least 350 MW of solar generation capacity by 2030. The utility earlier this year announced plans for 60-MW and 35-MW solar farms, asking for environmental assessments of those sites. HEP operates 13 rooftop solar arrays on its commercial buildings, with total generation capacity of 270 kW.

Hydrogen-Powered CHP System Announced. 2G Energy AG, an international manufacturer of gas-fueled combined heat and power (CHP) systems for decentralized energy supply, in July received an order to deliver a hydrogen-driven CHP system to Siemens AG. The 2G agenitor 412 forms part of a project on the Arabian Peninsula to produce hydrogen utilizing a solar-powered electrolysis plant manufactured by Siemens. The hydrogen is then harnessed for emission-free re-generation with the 2G CHP unit. The solar power will be generated in one of the world’s largest solar parks, which will be expanded to a capacity of 800 MW by mid-2020. This is a pilot project to test how the produced gas can be stored and converted back into electricity, or how it can be utilized for transportation purposes or other industrial applications. 2G is expected to deliver and install the hydrogen CHP by the end of the year. Siemens also supplied the electrolyzer for the hydrogen CHP project for Stadtwerke Hassfurt.

Geothermal Will Power Oil and Gas Field Operations. A pilot project in Swan Hills, Alberta, Canada will combine geothermal energy with existing infrastructure to power oil and gas exploration field operations. The project is being led by the University of Alberta (UA). UA researcher Jonathan Banks said the hybrid geothermal power plant is being built in collaboration with Razor Energy. Banks said, “The idea is to retrofit geothermal energy technology onto an existing oil and gas battery.” The project plans to connect to the Alberta power grid in early 2020, generating about 21 MW of power from two sources: 5 MW to 7 MW of renewable energy from heat-to-power generation, a combination of hot water heat and heat recovered from all sources at the battery site; and 15 MW of power from natural gas-fired generation. Doug Bailey, president and CEO of Razor Energy, said the goal is not only to use renewable energy to power field operations, but also to take revenue from selling the power produced by the waste heat. The project is funded by the Climate Change Innovation and Technology Framework through Alberta Innovates; Natural Resources Canada’s Clean Growth Program; and through the university’s Future Energy Systems project.

2-GW Gas Plant Set for Mozambique. The government of Mozambique said it plans to build a 2-GW gas-fired power station in Beluluane, in Boane district, about 30 kilometers west of Maputo. Beluluane Gas Co. SA received approval from the government to develop the $2.8 billion project. Beluluane will have exclusive rights for financing, constructing, operating, exploring, maintaining, and expanding infrastructure for importing, receiving, storing, treating, and exporting liquefied natural gas (LNG) for the new plant. The project is expected to be ready for commercial operation in 2024. A spokeswoman for the Mozambique government said the project is part of the country’s plan to have at least 8 GW of generation capacity installed by 2043, including infrastructure at the port of Matola for the handling, storing, re-gasifying, and exporting LNG, with a gas pipeline linking the port to the Beluluane power station. Mozambique plans to export power generated at Beluluane to South Africa and other markets in the Southern African Development Community region. It could also supply power to the Mozal aluminium smelter, which is located in Beluluane. Also in Mozambique, Scatec Solar and its partners in late July said they have grid-connected and started commercial operation for the 40-MW Mocuba solar power plant. The plant is located near Mocuba in the Zambézia province. Equity partners are KLP Norfund Investments (22.5%), EDM-Electricidade de Mozambique (25%), and Scatec Solar (52.5%). A 25-year power purchase agreement earlier was signed with state-owned utility EDM. ■

PT Pertamina Geothermal Energy is now preparing work on the 55 MW Unit 2 expansion at the 55 MW Lumut Balai geothermal power plant in South Sumatra, Indonesia. Planned start of operation is 2022.

As reported locally, PT Pertamina Geothermal Energy (PGE) is now preparing to develop the expansion of the 55 MW Lumut Balai geothermal power plant in South Sumatra, Indonesia.

PGE has successfully completed Lumut Balai Unit 1, which started commercial operation in August 2019 with an installed power generation capacity of 55 MW. The new expansion under way now with Unit 2 will have the same capacity of 55 MW, which would bring the total capacity to 110 MW.

PGE Managing Director Ali Mundakir said that his company would immediately explore Lumut Balai Unit 2 by searching for steam.

“For power plants and pipelines, JICA (Japan International Cooperation Agency) is funding,” Ali said last week.

He added, for the tender for the design, purchase, construction, and testing (engineering, procurement, construction, and commissioning / EPCC) will be carried out in 2020. “Lumut Balai Unit 2 is targeted for COD in 2022,” he explained.

In addition to working on the Lumut Balai Unit 2 project, by 2020 PGE is also preparing to work on Hulu Lais, Bengkulu Province and the Seulawah geothermal, Aceh Province.

For geothermal Hulu Lais, the capacity to be developed is 2x 55 MW. PGE has succeeded in finding steam reserves in three production wells. At present, drilling for injection wells is still underway.

“PGE only has to make a final investment decision with PLN because the power plant will be managed by PLN, PGE only sells its geothermal steam,” he explained.

Meanwhile, drilling in Seulawah, is planned for the end of 2020 by drilling three wells in stages.

To work on the three projects, PGE projects a budget of US $110 million.

Alexander Richter 14 Aug 2019

Pertamina Geothermal Energy has started commissioning of the 55 MW Lumut Balai Unit 1 geothermal power plant, with estimated start of commercial operation on September 9, 2019.

After two withdrawals from the initial COD targets, PT Pertamina Geothermal Energy (PGE) now ensures that the Lumut Balai Unit-1 Geothermal Power Plant (PLTP) could operate commercially (Commercial Operation Date / COD) in early September 2019.

PGE Managing Director Ali Mundakir said that, the 55 MW geothermal power plant had entered the commissioning stage which included synchronization to the electricity network of PT PLN (Persero) on 9 August 2019.

After the commissioning process is completed, Ali targets PLTP Lumut Balai to be COD on 3 September 2019. “Synchronization to the PLN network has been achieved on our August 9th. We are targeting COD on September 3, but we will try it if possible before September,” Ali said when met at the Jakarta Convention Center on Tuesday (8/13).

As for the COD setback, Ali was reluctant to say much. Technically, Ali said, his party needs to ensure that the electricity produced by Lumut Balai PLTP can be synchronized with the PLN electricity network.

Beyond that, Ali did not dismiss that there are social problems that must be solved first. “The social conditions of the community cannot be predicted,” he said.

For information, the Lumut Balai PLTP was previously targeted to be COD in December 2018. However, the target could not be reached and it was postponed to July 2019. Unfortunately, the charge also missed again.

Based on official information from the Directorate General of New Energy, Renewable and Energy Conservation (EBTKE) of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, there are a number of obstacles that have caused the delay of commercial operation of the plant.

These constraints include the limited area for power plant locations considering that Lumut Balai WKP is generally a high and steep topography so that it requires mitigation of potential landslides that are quite complex, backfeeding that cannot be done immediately, and unfinished readiness of the transmission network infrastructure.

For the next stage, continued Ali, PGE will soon complete PLTP Lumut Balai Unit-2, which also has a capacity of 55 MW in 2020. Ali said, completion between Unit 1 and Unit 2 usually takes about six months.

Meanwhile, for this year, Ali revealed that PGE allocated an investment fund of US $111 million. The funds will be absorbed for the completion of Lumut Balai PLTP and other operational needs, such as well drilling.

Ali said, PGE’s investment budget fluctuates every year. This year’s budget, said Ali, has shrunk compared to PGE’s investment funds last year which reached US $ 250 million. “This is because last year there was the construction of Lumut Balai. This year is almost complete, so (investment) is reduced,” he said.

Ali said that PGE funding came from two sources, namely PT Pertamina (Persero) and loans (soft loans) from financial institutions. On average, continued Ali, 60% of PGE funding came from PT Pertamina (Persero). As for the needs of the Engineering Procurement Construction (EPC) project, 40% of the project value is funded through soft loans.

As for the long-term plan, Ali said that PT Pertamina (Persero) had budgeted funds of US $ 2.68 billion for the investment needs of PGE geothermal development. “That is to increase the install capacity so that it can reach 1,112 MW in 2026,” he said.

operation	"Canadian Solar's 1.98-MWp solar park in Taiwan reaches COD

December 26 (Renewables Now) - Canadian Solar Inc (NASDAQ:CSIQ) announced this week that its 1.98-MWp Hualien Rongkai solar park in Taiwan is up and running.

The project, the solar panel maker’s first in the country, reached its commercial operation date (COD) on December 13. The Canadian company said TaiPower Inc is buying the output at TWD 4.922 (USD 0.16/EUR 0.15) per kWh under a 20-year feed-in tariff (FiT) contract.

The Hualien Rongkai park is equipped with 6,384 pieces of modules made by Canadian Solar at its Taiwanese factory. Its production is estimated at around 2,505 MWh of electricity per year.

Canadian Solar said it has an early stage pipeline of 43 MWp in Taiwan.

operation	"WHILE 2020 has generally been a fantastic year for glove and healthcare-related stocks, investors who took a chance a year ago on power company Mega First Corp Bhd have not done so badly for themselves.

The stock hit a record high of RM7.18 on June 30, more than double its closing price of RM3.50 on July 1, 2019. Analysts believe there is more upside, with all three brokerages covering the counter having “buy” calls and target prices ranging from RM7.50 to RM8.

The catalyst for this is undoubtedly Mega First’s prized project and cash cow, the 260mw Don Sahong hydropower project, a run-of-river scheme situated in the middle reach of the Mekong River in southern Laos.

Don Sahong fully commenced operations on Jan 7 this year, 15 years after the group first signed a memorandum of understanding for the project with the Laos government.

The energy generated by the plant is sold to Electricite Du Laos (EDL), the state corporation that runs and operates Laos’ electricity generation, transmission and distribution assets.

Annually, the project is expected to generate revenue of US$120 million (RM512.4 million) and a net profit attributable to shareholders of between US$60 million and US$70 million during its 25-year concession period starting from its financial year ending Dec 31, 2020.

Given that Laos experiences a dry season from November to early May, which does not bode well for hydropower projects, this threat of unfavourable weather conditions is a matter Mega First director Yeow See Yuen often gets asked about by analysts and fund managers.

He tells The Edge that Don Sahong delivered an average energy availability factor of 70.7% in the first quarter of 2020, during the dry season.

“In fact, the first quarter of this year saw Laos experience one of its driest seasons, and yet we were able to generate an availability factor of 70%, which in my opinion is very good.

“Our efficiency levels are based on the hydrology modelling our expert consultants have implemented. Also, our project is strategically located at the downstream part of the Mekong River, with many tributaries that contribute water flow into our system,” he says.

With the wet season having started in June, the availability factor for the plant is likely to improve.

“There will be progressively more rain after June and this is likely to peak in the third quarter of the year and the earlier part of the fourth quarter. In December, it will not be as wet, and the dry season will then [start] again in January.

“Overall (with both the wet and dry seasons combined), we are expecting Don Sahong to reach an efficiency level of close to 90%, which is in accordance with our hydrology modelling,” says Yeow.

On another common risk for hydropower projects, which is the recoverability of payment, Mega First guided in its financial report for the first quarter ended March 31, 2020 (1QFY2020), that it expects the receivables turnover from EDL to average around three months.

“We do not think payment collection from the Laos government is a risk as our power purchase agreement (PPA) with the government is guaranteed by its Ministry of Finance.

“Payment may be slower at times but we do not think that it will fall into a default situation as long as it has an outlet for our power.

“Today, Laos is a very big net exporter of power in the region. For example, Cambodia signed quite a few PPAs with the Laos government last year, totalling up to 3,200mw capacity. Vietnam has also signed a PPA with the Laos government, and Thailand stepped up the amount of power that it will be buying from Laos,” says Yeow.

Currently, the project runs on four turbines, but there are plans to add a fifth one.

“The fifth turbine will serve not just as additional capacity but also as a spare in case there is a need to service one of the existing four turbines during the dry season. We will fund this with our internal resources, though we may need to borrow a little bit,” Yeow reveals.

PublicInvest Research says in a July 13 note that the 65mw turbine will cost US$50 million, and is to be completed within the next three years.

Mega First’s gearing level as at 1Q2020 stood at 39%, which Yeow says is very low for a company that has a power project of Don Sahong’s magnitude. As at March 31, the group had total borrowings of RM736.94 million and cash balance of RM90.38 million.

“Our debt is around RM700 million and we have a cash flow per annum of RM400 million [from Don Sahong], so technically, we can be debt-free in the next couple of years,” says Yeow.

Diversifying its earnings

For 1QFY2020, the group reported revenues of RM160.69 million, of which its power division was the largest contributor at 64%. Its resources division, which is involved in the quarrying of limestone, contributed 21%.

Mega First’s packaging division, which is involved in the manufacturing of flexible packaging products as well as labels and printed products, contributed 12% to group revenue.

Earnings-wise, the group reported a net profit of RM57.4 million in 1QFY2020. The power division contributed more than 90% to the group’s operating profit.

“Among the feedback that I have received from analysts about our company is that we are single-project-dependent. To address this, we are building several platforms, which hopefully will grow in the next three to five years, so that we would no longer be just dependent on Don Sahong for earnings contribution to the group.

“The packaging division will be one platform, and so will our [coconut] plantations in Cambodia. We are also exploring other power projects in the renewables space,” says Yeow.

Meanwhile, PublicInvest Research says in its note that Mega First plans to participate in the Large Scale Solar 4 (LSS4) and rooftop solar power installation projects.

“For rooftop solar power installation projects, it targets to secure at least a total installed capacity of 10mw to 20mw every year in Malaysia and Cambodia under the build-operate-transfer business model, with an expected internal rate of return of at least 10%. Cambodia will see a greater return given the more attractive tariff rates there.

“The group [is also] in the midst of securing at least five solar power projects this year with an estimated electricity production yield of 15% to 17%. The projects will be under a net energy metering system,” the brokerage says.

PublicInvest Research maintained its “outperform” call on Mega First, with a higher target price of RM7.76, from RM7.47 previously.

In 2019, Mega First paid a total dividend per share (DPS) of six sen, which translates into a gross dividend yield of 0.9% based on last Wednesday’s closing price of RM6.43.

Maybank IB Research says in a July 3 note that cash generation for the Don Sahong project should catch up in the coming quarter.

“Management has not yet committed to a dividend policy. In our view, the balance sheet can comfortably support a 30 sen annual DPS,” the brokerage says.

A DPS of 30 sen indicates a yield of around 4.6%. Maybank IB Research has a “buy” call on Mega First with a target price of RM7.50."	https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/mega-first-surges-boost-power-segment
operation	"YOKOHAMA, Japan, Oct 10, 2019 – (JCN Newswire) – Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems, Ltd. (MHPS) completed the installation and commissioning of the natural gas-fired gas turbine combined cycle (GTCC) facilities for the “Jawa-2 Project.” The project, under the auspices of Indonesia’s state-owned electricity provider PT. PLN (Persero) is located at the Tanjung Priok Power Plant on Java Island. Commercial operation of Jawa-2 began last year for Units 1 and 2 in simple cycle mode. As with the simple cycle mode, the construction of the exhaust heat recovery boilers and steam turbine was completed ahead of schedule and allowed for an early turnover.

Jawa-2, located in the port city Tanjung Priok is approximately 10 km northeast of central Jakarta. The full turnkey contract was received by Mitsubishi Corporation and local construction and engineering firm Wasa Mitra Engineering. MHPS provided two M701F gas turbines, two exhaust heat recovery boilers, one steam turbine, and auxiliary equipment. The generators were manufactured by Mitsubishi Electric Corporation.

Indonesia is currently pursuing a large-scale thermal power expansion program centered on the West Java region around Jakarta. The Jawa-2 projects is part of a government initiative to add 35GW in generating capacity that is necessary to address the rapidly growing demand for power accompanying the country’s economic growth. MHPS’ successful completion of this project ahead of schedule contributed to the realization of the government’s plan. Also the project has been given an annual award in the category of “Natural Gas-Fired Power Project of the Year” from Asian Power Awards 2019.

An executive with PLN said, “This project is the realization of government’s program in Electricity Infrastructure development 35GW and is the first largest unit of the program. It can also be operated based on extraordinary coordination between PLN units and partners. The completion of the Jawa-2 CCPP project provides a great benefit for the availability of electricity supply in Jakarta and the strengthening of the Java-Bali electricity system as a load follower or peaker type generator.”

MHPS shipped its first steam turbine to Indonesia in 1971. Over the next nearly 50 years built a close relationship with the country and today continues to play an important role in ensuring a stable power supply for the nation.

Going forward, MHPS will continue to aim for an even greater share of the Indonesian power market, and through the widespread use of highly efficient power generation facilities, promote a shift to low-carbon energy, and contribute to the protection of the global environment."	https://www.powermag.com/press-releases/mhps-completes-880mw-natural-gas-fired-gtcc-jawa-2-project-for-indonesias-state-owned-electricity-provider-pln/
operation	"PHNOM PENH, Jan 8 (Reuters) - The Don Sahong hydropower dam in Laos has begun operations and this week connected its power grid to Cambodia, a Cambodian official said on Wednesday as the country steps up electricity imports after continued power outages last year.

Don Sahong, which was designed for an installed capacity of 260 megawatts (MW), is the second dam to begin operations on the Lower Mekong River within six months, after years of opposition from environmental activists.

The 1,285-megawatt Xayaburi Dam in Laos began supplying energy to Thailand in October.

Victor Jona, director general of energy at the Ministry of Mines and Energy, told Reuters that the link was connected on Tuesday.

“Don Sahong has a capacity of 195 megawatts, and the (state-run utility) Electricite du Cambodge will buy all of it,” he said.

He added that total capacity would only be reached in the annual rainy season starting around April, and output would likely be less during the current dry season.

The Lower Mekong River experienced record drought last year, and many parts along it have seen lower than usual water levels in the dry season.

Cambodia’s purchase price from the Don Sahong dam, which lies about 2 km north of the border in Laos, is $07.295 per kilowatt, Jona said. The deal will last for 30 years, he added.

“We are buying this electricity to supply our demand that increases from one year to another by between 18% and 20%,” he said.

Cambodia last year had the worst power outages in years as a surge in demand was fuelled by a construction boom accompanying Chinese investment.

Officials have said the electricity shortage was also due to low level water at hydropower dams across the country.

Cambodia uses hydropower for about 48% of its domestic electricity production, according to Electricite du Cambodge.

With demand growing fast, Cambodia imported about 25% of its electricity supply last year, with the bulk of it transmitted from Vietnam and Thailand, according to the state utility statistics.

operation	"Duke Energy Corp. DUK recently announced that its largest solar project — Holstein Solar — has come online. The project, based in Texas with total capacity of 200-megawatt alternating current (MWac), can power almost 40,000 homes.

Growing Solar Market in Texas

For the past couple of years, the United States has been witnessing a stark shift in preference of utility providers like Duke Energy toward enhancing their clean energy portfolio and shedding fossil-fuel energy sources like coal. The Holstein Solar Project is another testament to this fact.

As far as the state of Texas is concerned, a steady growth in its economy in recent times has boosted electricity consumption. As the nationwide consensus is in favor of adopting clean energy, the solar market is expanding rapidly in this state. Per the latest report by Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), Texas is poised to become a nationwide leader in solar energy, with more than 4 GW of capacity expected to be installed over the next five years.

Such projections clearly reflect the expansion opportunities that Texas is offering to utilities like Duke Energy that want to enhance their solar portfolio.

Notably, with the Holstein Solar project, the utility is now operating four solar generation facilities in Texas. Looking ahead, Duke Energy is working to complete construction of its 200-MWac Rambler Solar project in Tom Green County, which is expected to be in commercial operation by mid-2020. On this fifth project’s completion, the company’s total Texas solar energy portfolio will total 514 MWac.

Global Solar Boom: Duke Energy & Others

While Texas remains a lucrative market for solar players’ expansion, the global solar market has been rallying over the past decade. Per a report by Fortune Business Insights, the global solar power market size is projected to reach 4766.8 MW in 2026 from 2019, exhibiting a CAGR of 30.7%.

To reap the benefits from this expanding global solar market, Duke Energy and other utility providers are making every possible effort, which is expected to boost profits.

As one of the nation’s top renewable energy providers, Duke Energy currently owns, operates and contracts more than 8,000 MW of capacity and plans to double that by 2025.

During the first quarter of 2020, NextEra Energy NEE added 1,590 MW of renewable projects to its backlog, which includes 420 MW of solar and 457 MW of battery storage. The company operates more than 2,000 MW of solar generation.

Ameren Corp. AEE aims at expanding renewable sources by adding at least 100 MW of solar generation by 2027. On the other hand, Consolidated Edison ED generated 1,154 million kWh of electricity from solar projects for the three months ended Mar 31, 2020.

operation	"Invenergy, a privately held global developer and operator of sustainable energy solutions, says the 160 MW Southern Oak Solar Energy Center, located in Mitchell County, Ga., has begun commercial operations.

Construction began in 2018, and the project employed over 400 workers at its peak. In its first 10 years of operation alone, Southern Oak will generate more than $12 million in local economic development through agreements for tax payments and lease payments to participating landowners, as well as wages and benefits for employees.

“The start of commercial operations at Southern Oak is an incredible achievement for Invenergy as we celebrate not only our largest solar project, but also our 100th project to come online,” says Bryan Schueler, executive vice president and chief development officer at Invenergy.

“We are proud to have delivered on our promise to invest in the local economy and create jobs while leveraging our expertise to support Georgia Power in its efforts to increase solar development in Georgia,” he adds.

Southern Oak is Invenergy’s second project to deploy bifacial solar panels. Invenergy developed and constructed the 74 MW Wilkinson Solar project in North Carolina, which began commercial operations near the end of 2019 and was the company’s first project to use bifacial solar panels. The technology increases efficiency by capturing additional sunlight within the same project footprint.

Renewable Energy Systems (RES), a global company that provides engineering and construction services for wind, solar, transmission and energy storage projects, built the project.

Invenergy Services is operating the solar facility, adding to its 10 GW global sustainable energy project portfolio. Invenergy will maintain ownership of Southern Oak and is under a 30-year contract to sell 100% of the energy and renewable attributes from the facility to Georgia Power through the Renewable Energy Development Initiative (REDI) program.

As announced and provided by China National Energy Administration two years ago in 2016, only those pilot projects which would be able to be completed by the end of 2018 could enjoy the FiT of RMB1.5 per kWh. For fairness, the FiT will be surely reduced for the “delayed” projects, specifically speaking on the electricity price reduction mechanism: FiT for those with COD (Commercial Operation Date) by the year of 2019 will be RMB 1.14/kWh, only RMB 0.01/kWh lower than the benchmark price; and FiT for those with COD during the years of 2020 and 2021 will be RMB 1.10/kWh, a RMB 0.05/kWh lower gap.

COD (Year) FiT (RMB/CNY) 2018 1.15/kWh 2019 1.14/kWh 2020–2021 1.10/kWh

The policy is expected to be confirmed soon by China National Development and Reform Commission.

Looking forward to the year of 2020, the China CSP industry players will strive for the construction of around 10 CSP demonstration projects. Meanwhile, the continuous commissioning, operation & maintenance of the operational five commercial projects will be another crucial task.

operation	"The first solar thermal power plant in northwest China’s Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region went into operation Sunday night.

The 50-megawatt concentrated solar power plant is located in Naomaohu Township, eastern Xinjiang’s city of Hami. Construction of the project began in October 2017 by Energy China.

The concentrating solar power project can achieve an annual power supply of 198.3 million kWh, saving 61,900 tonnes of standard coal annually, which is equivalent to reducing emissions of about 61.89 tonnes of sulfur dioxide, 61.89 tonnes of nitrogen oxides, 19.84 tonnes of soot and 154,800 tonnes of carbon dioxide.

The solar thermal power plant adopts a «light-heat-electricity» power generation mode. The CSP project works by using tens of thousands of mirrors to concentrate sunlight on a receiver at the top of the tower to create a temperature above 800 degrees Celsius.

Steam with a temperature of over 500 degrees Celsius will then be generated through the heat transfer medium to drive a turbine to produce electricity.

The plant is able to generate power 24/7 through the use of molten salt that absorbs the heat, allowing the station to maintain the high temperature, even without a constant stream of sunlight.

In contrast to photovoltaic panels that cannot generate electricity at night and can easily be affected by weather changes, the solar thermal power plant can generate power steadily with lower cost and higher efficiency, said Zhang Yanli with the State Grid’s Hami branch.

China 6th large-scale commercial solar thermal power plant, CPECC Hami 50MW Molten Salt Tower CSP Project, was successfullly connected to the grid at 23:39 p.m. on December 29th, 2019, making the total capacity of large-scale CSP projects in China reach 350MW.

As CSP Focus keeps reporting, up to date, China have six large-scale CSP projects with total capacity of 350MW in operation:

CGN Delingha 50MW Parabolic Trough CSP Project, Shouhang Dunhuang 100MW Molten Salt Tower CSP Project, and SUPCON Delingha 50MW Molten Salt Tower CSP Project which were completed by 2018 year end;

Power China Gonghe 50MW Molten Salt Tower CSP Project and Luneng Haixi 50MW Molten Salt Tower CSP Project which started operation in September 2019;

CPECC Hami 50MW Molten Salt Tower CSP Project connected to the grid on December 29th, 2019.

Except the Luneng Haixi project, the other five are all amongst China first batch of 20 demonstration CSP projects.

CPECC Hami 50MW Molten Salt Tower CSP Project is developed by state-owned company China Power Engineering Consulting Group Corporation (CPECC) and the EPC contract was awarded to its subsidiary Northwest Electric Power Design Institute Company (NWEPDI).

As the only CSP pilot project in China Xinjiang Province, CPECC Hami CSP project is located in the highest latitude – 43°North.

With the total investment of RMB 1,580 million, the CPECC Hami project is equipped with 13 hours’ molten salt solar thermal storage system."	https://www.evwind.es/2019/12/30/xinjiangs-first-concentrated-solar-power-plant-operational/72831

operation	"Leading offshore wind developer Ørsted reported an operating profit (EBITDA) of DKK 6.8 billion (EUR 912 million) for the first quarter of 2020, a 33 percent increase compared to the same period the year before.

Net profit amounted to DKK 3.3 billion and return on capital employed (ROCE) came in at 11 percent for the period.

The company’s earnings from offshore and onshore wind farms in operation increased by 25 percent to DKK 5.2 billion. The increase was driven by the ramp-up of generation from the 1.2 GW Hornsea One offshore wind farm, and Lockett and Sage Draw onshore wind farms.

High wind speeds in Europe throughout the first quarter of 2020 also helped the increase in earnings, Ørsted said.

Offshore power generation increased by 48 percent, from 3.1 TWh in Q1 2019 to 4.6 TWh in Q1 2020, primarily due to the ramp-up of generation from Hornsea One.

Availability ended at 93 percent, which was below Q1 2019. This was mainly driven by low availability at Hornsea One and Borkum Riffgrund 2 due to cable replacement campaign and outages, respectively.

Outlook and the Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic

Back in March, Ørsted increased its EBITDA guidance from DKK 15-16 billion to DKK 16-17 billion due to updated assumptions regarding the divestment of the transmission asset for Hornsea One.

At this point in time, the company has no indication that the COVID-19 pandemic will significantly impact its earnings for the year. The expectation of gross investments of DKK 30-32 billion in 2020 has also been reiterated.

“Despite the COVID-19 crisis and its profound impact on societies around the world, we have had a very good start to the year with strong financial results and solid operational performance across the entire business,” Henrik Poulsen, CEO and President of Ørsted, said.

”During the last couple of months, our asset base has been fully operational with availability rates for our wind farms and power stations within the normal range.”

Poulsen has, however, pointed to an increased risk of component and service delays from suppliers impacted by COVID-19.

The Delingha 50MW solar thermal power plant constructed by CGN New Energy, a subsidiary of China General Nuclear Power Corporation, in the northwestern province of Qinghai was put into operation on October 10th, 2018.

As China’s first large commercial parabolic-trough concentrated solar power (CSP) plant, the operation of the solar power makes China the eighth country in the world to have a large solar thermal power station, said Li Yilun, managing director of CGN New Energy.

This is a landmark for the company’s solar-thermal energy development after more than ten years of development, he said during a news conference held in Beijing on Wednesday.

According to Li, CGN’s solar power business, after more than ten years’ development, currently covers 29 provinces nationwide, with an installed capacity exceeding 2.58 million kilowatts that ranks third across the country.

Li said compared with photovoltaic power, the CSP features continuous and steady generation of electricity, enjoying greater development potential.

Built on a sparsely populated plateau, 3,000 meters above sea level, the Delingha power plant occupies an area of 2.46 square kilometers (246 hectares). The plant was connected to the grid with the power block part for the first time successfully on June 30th, 2018.

Joseph Jacobelli, a senior analyst of Asian utilities at Bloomberg Intelligence, said the commissioning of the CGN New Energy project is evidence that Chinese electricity producers remain very keen on developing clean energy.

“Chinese power producers are all seeking more advanced solutions,” said Jacobelli.

“We would expect that companies such CGN New Energy will continue to seek out more advanced wind, solar and energy storage technologies in coming years.”

Chances are high that these Chinese clean energy companies will continue expanding in the clean energy sectors abroad in coming years, as many companies are stepping up their performance in overseas markets, actively investing in assets abroad buoyed by the China-led Belt and Road Initiative, he added.

According to Wang Zhigang, managing director of the Delingha project, the solar power project located on the plateau with cold temperatures and oxygen deficiency is capable of producing some 200 million kilowatt hours annually and replace more than 60,000 tons of standard coal each year and 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide emission every year.

The main part of the project commenced construction in August 2015, and is the country’s first solar thermal power plant connected to the power grid. It is also the first solar thermal power project that received a preferential loan from the Asian Development Bank, said the company.

CGN has also been developing in other forms of new energy in recent years in addition to nuclear power, including the country’s first large scale offshore wind power project in Shanghai, he said.

The wind farm produces renewable energy under a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with Associated Electric Cooperative, an electric generation and transmission cooperative based in Springfield, Missouri, that provides wholesale power to six regional cooperatives, including NW Electric Power Cooperative Inc. of Cameron, Missouri, and 51 local cooperative systems in Missouri, southeast Iowa and northeast Oklahoma that serve 910,000 members.

“Clear Creek helps us advance Associated’s strategy to deliver reliable, affordable and responsible power to our member-owners,” said David J. Tudor, Associated CEO and general manager. “Power from this resource contributes to our diverse and balanced energy mix and helps ensure we can continue to deliver benefits to our members.”

The wind farm is owned by Tenaska Clear Creek Wind, LLC, which is comprised of affiliates of Tenaska and Bright Canyon Energy.

“We invested in this wind farm to gain operational experience with wind, and we could not have found a better partner for our first undertaking than Tenaska, a company that brings to the table innovation, commitment and rigor,” said Bright Canyon General Manager Jason Smith. “Clear Creek will provide clean energy to customers in the Midwest for years to come and serve as a model resource to make America’s energy mix more and more green through the coming decades. We are proud to be a part of that effort.”

In January, we had reported that Bright Canyon had acquired ownership interests in two Tenaska-developed wind projects. The transaction, which closed December 20, 2019, includes the purchase of indirect minority interests in both Tenaska Clear Creek Wind, owner of Tenaska Clear Creek Energy Center in Missouri, and Nobles 2 Power Partners, owner of the Nobles 2 wind farm in Minnesota."	https://www.saurenergy.com/solar-energy-news/242-mw-wind-farm-begins-commercial-operation-in-missouri

ENGIE Africa consortium begins operation of Egypt’s first largest wind farm

By

November 4, 2019: ENGIE Africa has announced that the construction and commissioning of the 262.5 MW Ras Ghareb wind farm in Egypt is complete 45 days ahead of schedule. The wind farm is now fully connected to the grid and is ready for commercial operation at maximum capacity.

The project company, Ras Ghareb Wind Energy SAE is owned by ENGIE (40 percent) and its consortium partners Toyota Tsusho Corporation/Eurus Energy Holdings Corporation (40 percent) and Orascom Construction (20 percent). The wind farm is located near Ras Ghareb on the Gulf of Suez, an optimal site with about 60 percent of gross capacity factor. The energy is sold under a 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA) to the Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company (EETC). The total investment cost of the project is approximately $380 million.

Ras Ghareb Wind Energy is the first wind farm tendered on a build-own-operate (BOO) scheme and is part of the Egyptian government’s drive to increase the share of renewables in the energy mix with a target wind generation capacity of 7 GW by 2022.

Yoven Moorooven, CEO of ENGIE Africa commented, “There is a huge potential for low-cost renewable energy in Africa. We are honoured that the Egyptian authorities have selected the ENGIE consortium to be part of their strategic energy plan. ENGIE’s clean energy solutions are based on competitiveness, reliability and safety. Ras Ghareb Wind Energy has been developed with a continuous focus on Health and Safety and is completely in line with ENGIE’s ambition in the zero-carbon transition. We are committed to apply the same standards with the same success for the adjacent 500 MW wind farm that is being developed by this consortium.”

The consortium arranged non-recourse project financing from the Japan Bank for International Corporation (JBIC) in coordination with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and Société Générale under a Nippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI) cover. Commercial International Bank (CIB) Egypt is acting as working capital bank and Attijariwafa Bank provided an equity bridge loan for Orascom Construction.

With its global references in areas such as facility management, gas distribution, cold networks or green mobility, ENGIE is also keen to develop its service activities and energy solutions for smart cities in Egypt.

ENGIE’s ambition is to become a world leader in a competitive “as a service” zero-carbon transition and the Group is focusing on renewables to accelerate the energy transition. With 93 percent of its businesses low-carbon, ENGIE has set a target of developing 9 GW of additional renewable capacity by 2021, and intends to invest approximately €2.5 billion in the sector."	https://www.logupdateafrica.com/engie-africa-consortium-begins-operation-of-egypts-first-largest-wind-farm-trade-e-commerce
operation	"U.S. engineering, procurement and construction firms Zachry Group and McDermott International announced that third train of the Freeport (Texas) liquefied natural gas (LNG) project has begun commercial operations.

McDermott and Zachry partnered with Chiyoda International Corp. on building the Freeport project. These trains will be part of a process liquefying U.S. natural gas by chilling it for safe shipping and then transport to global markets for heating and power generation.

“Congratulations to the entire team for upholding the high safety and quality standards for which we’re known,” said Mark Coscio, McDermott’s Senior Vice President for North, Central and South America. “We have previously achieved substantial completion of Trains 1 and 2, and Train 3 now brings our joint venture project to full commercial operation.”

Zachry Group, as the joint venture lead, partnered with McDermott for the Pre-FEED in 2011, followed by FEED works to support the early development stage of the project as a one-stop shop solution provider for Trains 1 and 2. Later Chiyoda joined the joint venture partnership for work related to Train 3. The project scope includes three pre-treatment trains, a liquefaction facility with three trains, a second loading berth and a 165,000-cubic-meter full containment LNG storage tank.

The Freeport LNG facility incorporates what the companies called the largest electric motor-driven refrigeration compressors in the world and, now with full commercial operations, will significantly improve North America’s energy export capabilities, the companies said.

Project developer Freeport LNG Development LP and Westbourne Capital agreed on a $1.025 billion loan last year to fund the addition of a fourth train in the near future. KBR was signed on to lead EPC duties for that new project.

The revolution in shale and directional drilling has pushed U.S. natural gas production to around 100 billion cubic feet per day, positioning the nation as an energy exporter. Several companies have built, are building or planning export and liquefaction terminals and plan to move gas for power generation to regions such as Europe, Africa and Asia.

Natural gas fuels 38 percent of the U.S. electricity generation mix, according to a recent report from the EIA. Gas is expected to surpass 40 percent of that mix this year, with several new combined cycle gas turbine plants under construction."	https://www.power-eng.com/2020/05/06/third-freeport-lng-train-begins-commercial-operations/

operation	"ENGIE invests significantly in both utility-scale and off-grid renewable power projects in Africa. In this exclusive interview, Yoven Moorooven, Chief Executive Officer of ENGIE Africa, explains the company’strategy

ENGIE faced a steep learning curve as a first mover in Africa’s renewable energy sector. But the company and its African customers and partners are now reaping the rewards.

ENGIE Africa employs around 4,000 people across the continent from Morocco to Uganda. Many of them work in the off-grid sector, designing and installing infrastructure, and providing services for solar powered mini-grids and individual solar home systems. But ENGIE operates right across the sector, having invested substantially in grid-scale renewables and the expansion of its energy services business.

“Our approach in the last couple of years has been to say: we know Africa is huge and has a lot of challenges, but we can develop the business in a way that makes the most impact, both in terms of bringing economic value to us as a company, and to individual countries and their people,” explains CEO Yoven Moorooven.

That approach has resulted in the creation of a diverse project portfolio, both in terms of project type and geographical distribution, and it is one that is growing fast. ENGIE now has some 3 GW of renewables and thermal generating capacity in Africa and can provide more than 4.5m people with access to electricity. Another 12 GW of capacity is in the project pipeline.

ENGIE has been operating for some years in two of the continent’s most dynamic markets, South Africa and Morocco. In South Africa, its portfolio of wind, solar photovoltaic (PV) and concentrated solar power projects has added some 1.2 GW of capacity. In Morocco, a joint venture with local partner Nareva Holding operates the 300 MW Tarfaya wind farm. ENGIE also operates thermal power plants in both countries.

The growth of interest in renewables on the continent means ENGIE Africa has been able to expand into new markets. ENGIE and its partners inaugurated Egypt’s largest wind farm, the 262.5 MW Ras Ghareb project, in December 2019. In Tunisia, it is working on a 120 MW solar PV project, while in Senegal it is starting construction of two 30 MW solar PV projects. The company has also signed an agreement with the government of Djibouti to build a 30 MW solar PV project there in partnership with Électricité de Djibouti.

On the off-grid side, ENGIE bought home solar solutions pioneer Mobisol in September 2019 to complement its existing Fenix International home solar business and its ENGIE PowerCorner mini-grid business. Moorooven is a firm believer that off-grid renewable energy, in both urban and rural environments, will become an increasingly important partner to utility scale generation in the drive to bring energy access to all Africans, as envisaged in the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

Building on the utility scale and off-grid renewables businesses, the company also runs an Energy Services business that provides installation, maintenance, facility management and other energy services across the continent.

Tailored strategies

Making a success of these investments has required strategies tailored to the specific market segments. For smaller off-grid developments, that has meant devising what Moorooven describes as a “plug and play” strategy, whereby an approach to scaling up the business is road tested in one African country and, if it works, applied in other countries with suitable operational frameworks.

This strategy has allowed ENGIE to expand its off-grid business for communities and individuals, building on pioneering projects in Uganda and Tanzania with operations in Mozambique, Kenya, Rwanda, Zambia, Benin, Côte d’Ivoire, and Nigeria.

For utility-scale and larger off-grid projects, ENGIE is focusing on establishing activities in a relatively small group of countries with conducive operational frameworks, rather than spreading itself more thinly across many markets where it may be more difficult to get projects done.

“It is important for us to build a stronghold in countries where we have a physical presence. We’ve scaled up our operations in South Africa and Morocco so now we would like to get scale in other countries, such as Egypt and Senegal,” Moorooven says.

ENGIE also adopts a “quick entry/quick exit” strategy. If things aren’t going well in a new market, the company would rather leave and look elsewhere for more productive opportunities than stay for years trying to make further projects work there.

“Like any company, we have constraints on capital and resources, so this is just a good way of doing business,” he says.

Financial sustainability is another central plank of ENGIE’s approach to its African projects. The company believes it is better to invest in projects that are able to stand on their own two feet commercially, rather than those reliant on subsidies for survival.

“It’s not about getting a short-lived win until the subsidies – and probably the business – disappear. What is important for us is that a business is sustainable and profitable over the long term,” he says.

Better business environment

Moorooven is well placed to assess prospects for investment in the African power sector in an increasingly competitive global marketplace. He took over as ENGIE Africa’s CEO in April 2018, having originally joined the company as part of its Global Energy Management team in 2013. His experience before that included stints at Gaselys in Paris and then Macquarie, where he became Head of EMEA Energy Origination in 2010 when he was just 31 years old.

He remains positive on the investment outlook for African renewable energy projects, while expressing caution over the extent to which the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic will be felt in the sector.

“Nobody knows what the full effect will be, but Africa has managed the situation pretty well, when it comes to Covid-19. I think we will see African economies adopting a new normal and working things out,” he says. “The challenge will be to ensure that Africa does not drop down the priority list for external investors, who have fewer financial resources than they did before the pandemic. African projects will continue to need these external investments and African governments may be reluctant even to try to launch major energy projects, if they don’t think enough investors will participate.”

Despite the challenges resulting from the pandemic, he believes the African power sector is still a good prospect for a company such as ENGIE that is seeking to scale up its operations.

“It’s getting better to do business on the continent, and with such a young population, demand is going to grow fast. The business environment is improving by the day,” he says."	https://africanbusinessmagazine.com/company-profile/engie/engie-plays-the-long-game-in-africa/
operation	Johnson City – Sunflower Electric Power Corp. and Lightsource BP have announced that the Johnson Corner Solar Project entered commercial operation on April 7. The $37 million project, which was financed and constructed by Lightsource BP, is located approximately two miles southwest of Johnson City in Stanton County. Lightsource BP, a global leader in the development, financing and management of utility-scale solar energy projects, is the project owner and operator. All the energy from the project is being sold under a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) to Sunflower, a not-for-profit electric utility providing wholesale generation and transmission services to six member-owners serving in central and western Kansas. The National Renewables Cooperative Organization (NRCO) played a key role in helping Sunflower develop this important project for the public power community. “Sunflower is proud to have worked with Lightsource BP and NRCO to bring online the state’s largest solar project to date,” said Stuart Lowry, president and CEO of Sunflower. “The Johnson Corner Solar Project adds yet another renewable fuel source to our diversified generation portfolio, which is designed to protect both the affordability and reliability of the energy we provide to our members.” The project delivers 20 megawatts (AC) of clean and affordable on-peak electricity – enough to power the peak demand of over 4,900 homes across Sunflower’s service territory and more than doubling the state’s utility-scale solar capacity, previously at 14.1 megawatts. In addition to providing low-cost, onpeak energy, the Johnson Corner Solar Project will reduce loading on a nearby transmission line that is approaching capacity. As a result, Sunflower’s members will save costs by deferring or ultimately canceling the requirement for expensive infrastructure upgrades. “Lightsource BP is pleased to be part of this project and in helping to keep rates low for electric cooperative members due to value derived from clean and low cost energy supply and transmission savings,” said Kevin Smith, CEO of Lightsource BP in the Americas. “We applaud Sunflower Electric Power Corp. for their leadership in bringing the many benefits of solar energy to their communities in central and western Kansas.” The project created more than 200 jobs during peak construction, with the workforce dispatched across 144 acres. Lightsource BP’s construction general contractor was Sterling and Wilson, who hired local subcontractors and recruited from the local labor pool. Precautions and guidelines provided by the CDC and public officials were followed on site, as well as implementation by Sterling and Wilson of additional strict measures to ensure the safety of the workers and mitigate the spread of COVID-19.	https://www.gbtribune.com/news/business/largest-solar-firm-kansas-starts-commercial-operation/
operation	"Indonesia expects 185 MW in addition to geothermal capacity in 2019

Alexander Richter 26 Jul 2019

Indonesia's Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources expects an addition of 185 MW of new geothermal power generation capacity to be added until the end of 2019 by the plants of Lumut Balai, Muara Laboh, Sorik Marapi, and Sokoria.

Four geothermal power plants (PLTP) with a total capacity of 185 megawatts are targeted to start commercial operations until the end of 2019.

The four plants are Lumut Balai Unit 1 PLTP in South Sumatra with a 55 MW capacity operated by PT Pertamina Geothermal Energy (PGE), Muara Laboh Unit 1 PLTP in West Sumatra with an 80 MW capacity by PT Supreme Energy, Sorik Merapi 1 PLTP in Sumatra North with a capacity of 45 MW by PT Sorik Merapi Geothermal Power, and Sokoria 1 PLTP in NTT with a capacity of 5 MW by PT Sokoria Geothermal Indonesia with a capacity.

Director of Geothermal Energy at the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources Ida Nuryatin Finahari said that his side continues to push for a new renewable energy mix (EBT), especially geothermal energy, to continue to increase. The commercial operation date (COD) target of geothermal plants has increased in 2019 from last year’s realization.

Whereas in 2018 there were only two PLTPs that carried out COD, namely the Sarulla PLTP Unit 3 in the Sibual Buali geothermal working area (WKP), North Sumatra, with a capacity of 110 MW and Karaha PLTP in the Karaha Cakrabuana WKP, West Java, with a capacity of 30 MW.

In addition to encouraging COD for a number of geothermal plants under construction, the ESDM Ministry also encouraged the realization of WKP work that had been completed during the exploration period. The latest, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources awaits a proposal from PGE in managing the WKP Kotamobagu.

The proposal contains a work program from PGE in managing the Kotamobagu WKP. PGE is expected to be able to send proposals as soon as possible so that the development of the power plant in the WKP can be immediately implemented. Moreover, currently the ESDM Ministry is pushing for an EBT mix of 23 percent by 2025 to be realized soon.

“Now it’s just waiting for when they submit a proposal that contains a work program. We expect it as soon as possible,” so news from Indonesia.

We will report from the 7th Indonesia International Geothermal Conference & Exhibition from Jakarta 13-15 August 2019.

operation	"The wind farm is equipped with 125 2.1 MW wind turbines.

Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy (SGRE) announced starting commercial operation of the largest wind farm ever built in Egypt, the 262.5 MW Ras Ghareb project, located in the Gulf of Suez, close to Ras Ghareb town.

The wind farm, equipped with 125 2.1 MW wind turbines, was completed 45 days ahead of schedule.

The 262.5 MW project is executed on a build-own-operate basis under a 20-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with the Egyptian Energy Transmission Company, marking the first renewable energy project of its kind and size in Egypt for an Independent Power Producer.

It has been conducted by Ras Ghareb Wind Energy S.A.E, a company created in 2017, comprising ENGIE, Toyota Tsusho Corporation & Eurus Energy Holdings Corporation, and Orascom Construction.

To mark the event, an opening ceremony was celebrated today at site of the wind farm, with representatives from the companies involved, including Siemens Gamesa, and institutions.

The project has been a driver of economic growth and job creation in the area during the construction of the wind farm, as most of the suppliers were local. It has specifically involved a total of more than 50 subcontractors across the area, creating approximately 140 jobs.

The 15-year service agreement, provided by local workforce, will also help increase activity and employment in the area. Some of these local suppliers are El-Masria Equipment, that supplied the cranes, SIAG, DSD Ferrometalco, and NSF, that manufactured all the towers locally, along with support from Power Zone and Petrotec.

Apart from the job creation, the projects led to industrial integration and value chain, which is one of the main priorities of Siemens Gamesa for a sustainable development of Egypt and Africa in general.

Managing Director of Siemens Gamesa in Egypt Ayman Saad, highlighted during the event: “Since 2005, as the first company to deliver clean wind energy in the country, Egypt has always been a key market for Siemens Gamesa. This project, which strengthens our commitment to the country, is unique in the history of our presence in Africa, since we have been able to install the wind turbines in record time: 45 days ahead of schedule. The production of five turbine foundations per week by Orascom Construction ensured the supply of the wind turbines was seamless. The learnings we have amassed from this project from conception to completion will be carried through to all other projects in Egypt and the continent.”

“The country offers huge growth potential in wind power, especially in the Gulf of Suez and the Nile Valley. It is one of the 15 countries worldwide presenting the greatest potential for growth, as it is expected to install 6,500 MW of wind power capacity by 2026. Today, Siemens Gamesa is the market leader in Egypt. With the new capacity of Ras Ghareb, Siemens Gamesa has a total of 1,249 GW installed in the country,” added Saad.

The building of the wind farm comes as part of the Egyptian government’s plan to increase dependency on renewable energy sources so that the ratio of power generation from renewable sources reaches 20% of Egypt’s electricity production by 2022, and 42% by 2035."	https://www.evwind.es/2019/12/11/siemens-gamesa-completes-the-262-5-mw-ras-ghareb-project-egypts-biggest-wind-farm/72396

It is the largest and the first privately owned wind farm in Egypt. The project is now connected to the grid and is ready for commercial operation at its maximum capacity. The wind farm has been constructed near Ras Ghareb on the Gulf of Suez with around 60% gross capacity.

The project company, Ras Ghareb Wind Energy, is owned by ENGIE (40%), while its consortium partner Toyota Tsusho/Eurus Energy Holdings Corporation has 40%, and Orascom Construction owns the remaining 20%.

As per the company statement, Ras Ghareb Wind Energy is the first wind farm tendered on Build, Own, Operate (BOO) basis and is a part of the Egyptian government’s aim to increase the share of renewables in the energy mix and achieve the target of wind generation capacity of 7 GW by 2022.

Speaking about the commissioning of Ras Ghareb Wind Energy, Yoven Moorooven, CEO of ENGIE Africa, said, “There is a huge potential for low-cost renewable energy in Africa. We are honored that the Egyptian authorities have selected the ENGIE consortium to be part of their strategic energy plan. Ras Ghareb Wind Energy has been developed with a continuous focus on Health and Safety and is completely in line with ENGIE’s ambition in the zero-carbon transition. We are committed to apply the same standards with the same success for the adjacent 500 MW wind farm that is being developed by this consortium.”

The consortium secured non-recourse project financing from the Japan Bank of International Corporation (JBIC) in coordination with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and Société Générale under a Nippon Export and Investment Insurance cover.

The French multinational has been trying to expand its footprint in Africa, and in one such move, the company acquired Mobisol, an off-grid solar solutions corporation. With the acquisition of Mobisol, ENGIE will provide solar home systems in three additional countries in addition to the six where it already has a presence through its sister concern—Fenix International. Engie completed the acquisition of Fenix International in April 2018.

Meanwhile, the company’s total renewable capacity in India has crossed 1.5 GW after Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Limited (GUVNL) awarded a 280 MW solar project as part of the state’s Raghanesda Solar Park, which is currently under development."	https://mercomindia.com/engie-africa-commissions-egypt-largest-wind-farm/

International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, will assist the government, as transaction adviser, in defining the parameters and requirements to design and tender the first solar public-private partnership (PPP) project in Kosovo*, IFC told Balkan Green Energy News.

Private partners will participate in the open-bidding, competitive tender where the offered price will be the auction parameter, IFC said in an emailed response when asked to clarify a September 24 statement by the Ministry of Economic Development.

“Companies that participate in the bidding process will be pre-qualified for that purpose,” according to the response.

The planned solar power plant’s location has not been decided yet.

The Ministry of Economic Development said in the September 24 statement following the signing of a cooperation agreement with IFC that the financial institution is advising the government on the development of a 50 MW solar power plant.

According to the statement, the project will help meet part of Kosovo’s* obligations towards the EU concerning the diversification of its energy mix.

In September, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) invited expressions of interest in providing it with consultancy services in order to support the Government of Kosovo* in developing and implementing a competitive scheme for the award of future support to renewable energy generators.

The deadline to file expressions of interest expired on October 10.

A year ago, the ministry announced that it aimed to transfer the quota of 100-120 MW for hydropower projects to solar and wind power projects.

25% renewables share targeted by 2020

Kosovo* currently generates almost all of its electricity from coal-fired power plants with a combined installed capacity of 1,000 MW.

The current renewables capacity amounts to approximately 70 MW of small hydropower plants and a 32.4 MW wind farm in eastern Kosovo*, which reached commercial operation in October 2018. A 105 MW wind farm in northern Kosovo* is under development and expected to commence commercial operations in 2021.

Two solar projects with a capacity of 6 MW have been put into operation.

Kosovo* is estimated to have a strong solar potential given its average of 278 sunny days and 2,000 hours of sun per year.

As a member of the Energy Community, Kosovo* has committed to reaching a 25% share of renewable energy sources in final gross energy consumption (currently at approximately 20%) by 2020. The Kosovo* Energy Strategy has set the target of introducing around 400 MW of renewables into the system by 2026."	https://balkangreenenergynews.com/ifc-to-help-kosovo-design-tender-its-first-solar-ppp-project/

Kosovo recently raised its renewable energy target to an additional 400 MW of capacity by 2026. That would be enough to meet a quarter of its power demand and reduce dependence on ageing coal power plants. The previous plan for renewables development, put in place in the summer of 2016, stipulated the addition of just 10 MW of solar while targeting around 250 MW of overall clean energy capacity.

Most of Kosovo’s electricity is supplied as imports and from two lignite-fired thermal power plants, the 40-year-old Kosovo A Power Station (with a 345 MW generation capacity) near Pristina, and the upgraded, 27-year-old Kosovo B Power Station (540 MW) in Obilić.

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has invited expressions of interest in providing it with consultancy services in order to support the Government of Kosovo* in developing and implementing a competitive scheme for the award of future support to renewable energy generators.

The EBRD previously engaged with the Kosovo* authorities on the development of a bankable framework for renewable energy sources, including a power purchase agreement (PPA), for wind generation.

The framework was agreed in 2019 and has now been applied for the sole operational wind farm as well as the wind farm currently under development. In July 2019, the EBRD received a request from the Ministry of Economic Development of Kosovo* to assist in the design and implementation of competitive procurement for renewable energy capacity.

The assignment involves conducting a review of existing materials relevant to renewable energy development in Kosovo*, designing a competitive bidding process for supporting renewable energy, preparing the documentation needed for Kosovo’s* first renewable energy tender, and providing implementation support to the authorities to administer the tender, according to the EBRD’s website.

The deadline to file expressions of interest is October 10.

The expected outcome of the assignment is the implementation of wind auctions in Kosovo*.

Amongst others, the selected consultant is expected to provide the following services:

Develop a detailed design and strengthen the overall legal and regulatory framework for a competitive bidding process (i.e. renewable energy auctions) for the procurement of renewable energy; Develop all auction documentation required for a solar PV auction and a wind auction; Provide the authorities with detailed technical, financial and legal assistance for the implementation of one round of auctions; Develop framework for a future competitive procurement scheme.

The company's chief financial officer, Robert Durian, told analysts during its Q1 earnings conference call he was now expecting ""a decline of 5% of Alliant's overall retail sales this year.""

Alliant's utilities and corporate services operations generated 72 cents/share of GAAP earnings per share in Q1, an increase of 20 cents/share year on year.

The primary driver of the increase was higher rate bases for Alliant's two utilities: Interstate Power and Light, which is active in Iowa, and Wisconsin Power and Light. A rate hike for IPL that had earlier been approved by the Iowa Utilities Board went into effect February 26.

Nonetheless, in Q1, Alliant said: ""These items were partially offset by lower electric and [natural] gas sales volumes largely caused by warmer-than-normal temperatures in early 2020 and higher depreciation expenses.""

John Larsen, Alliant's CEO, told analysts that as part of the company's ""generation transition,"" it brought 400 MW of wind capacity online in Iowa in Q1, and expected to add 200 MW of additional wind capacity ""later this year.""

On March 27, IPL's 200-MW Golden Plains Wind facility in north central Iowa achieved commercial operation. The facility was built by EDF Renewables.

It also brought online in Q1 its 200-MW Whispering Willow North facility in Franklin County near the center of the state. The facility is an expansion of its 200-MW Whispering Willow East Wind farm, which was brought online in 2009.

The 130-MW Richland wind farm under construction in Sac County, in the western part of Iowa, is forecast to become commercial in the third quarter of 2020.

By the end of 2020, Alliant said it expects its Iowa operations to own and run 1,299 MW of wind generation.

Alliant's WPL unit is expected to bring its 150-MW Kossuth Wind facility online in the final quarter of 2020. That facility is being built by Invenergy in Kossuth County, Iowa, which is in northern Iowa near the border with Minnesota. WPL has said the facility will generate power ""on behalf"" of its Wisconsin customers.

""This will complete our 1,000 MW of new renewables approved by the Iowa Utility Board,"" Larsen said, ""and the 150-MW approved by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin.""

Larsen added that Alliant is ""now entering the regulatory approval phase"" of its proposed 1,000 MW solar buildout in Wisconsin.

""We are in advanced discussions with developers and anticipate filing a certificate of authority for approximately two-thirds of the 1,000 MW by the end of this quarter,"" he said."	https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/050820-alliant-says-retail-power-sales-fell-9-in-april-forecasts-a-5-decline-for-all-of-2020
operation	"Alliant Energy and EDF Renewables say the 200 MW Golden Plains project has achieved commercial operation and is now delivering clean electricity to Iowa customers.

Located in Winnebago and Kossuth counties in north-central Iowa, the Golden Plains Wind Farm was developed and constructed by EDF Renewables. The farm utilizes 82 GE wind turbines to generate electricity. With Golden Plains, EDF Renewables has developed or placed in service 1.4 GW of wind energy capacity in the state.

“Wind energy is a win for Iowans,” says Terry Kouba, president of Alliant Energy’s Iowa energy company.

“This project benefits customers and the environment through reductions in emissions and fuel costs. It also gives landowners lease payments, and it helps communities through increased local tax revenue for schools and community services,” adds Kouba.

The project injected millions of dollars into the local economy and employed hundreds of workers at the peak of construction.

By the end of 2020, Alliant Energy’s Iowa energy company expects to own and operate 1,299 MW of wind generation in the state. This expansion plans to provide enough renewable energy to create hundreds of jobs during construction, generate hundreds of millions in local property taxes throughout the life of the wind farms and pay hundreds of millions of dollars in lease payments to landowners.

Alliant Energy’s target is to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 40% by the year 2030 across their entire service area in Iowa and Wisconsin.

“We are pleased to partner with Alliant Energy to deliver competitively-priced, clean energy to its customers through the Golden Plains Wind Project,” says Kate O’Hair, vice president of development of the North Region at EDF Renewables.

“The project provides an economic boost to the Iowa economy, through new construction and operations jobs, expanded tax base and recurring, long-term income for participating landowners,” adds O’Hair.

German energy utility RWE announced that it has begun operations of the 57MW Morcone wind farm, located near Naples, Italy.

The wind farm is powered by 19 of Vestas 3MW class turbines, each of which has rotor blades reaching a height of 140m. The project can generate enough clean energy to power 65,000 Italian households annually.

Construction on the wind farm began in the mountainous terrain around Morcone in 2018, and the plant began to partially generate electricity from last June.

RWE Renewables CEO Anja-Isabel Dotzenrath said: “The Morcone site represents another step to strengthen our position as a leading producer of renewable energy. It is our largest onshore wind farm in terms of capacity in Italy.

“Italy is one of our core markets for wind energy. The country is seeing continued expansion of renewables and we are happy to contribute to this development.”

With the Morcone wind farm beginning operations, RWE Renewables will now have 15 onshore wind farms with a total capacity of around 440MW.

In addition, the company is also building another wind project at a site in Alcamo in the region of Sicily.

E.ON started building the Morcone wind farm in 2018

E.ON had originally started the wind project’s construction, after winning the project in an auction held by the Italian government in 2016.

As per RWE, the Italian energy market has ambitious renewable targets set by the Italian National Energy and Climate Plan. The targets are supported by an incentive scheme based on two-sided Contracts for Difference (CfD) auctions until next year.

The agreements are expected to offer clear and predictable revenues for project developers.

Earlier this month, RWE had secured approval to build the 47.6MW Clachaig Glen wind farm from the Scottish Government.

Powered by 14MW turbines, the wind farm will be located on the Mull of Kintyre in Argyll & Bute and is expected to begin operations in July 2024."	https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/news/rwe-morcone-wind-farm-italy/

With support from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the country is now holding its first renewables auctions, and targeting 400MW of renewable capacity to be online by 2025.

Kosovo completed its first 32.4MW wind project in 2018, developed by Turkish firm Güris. A 105MW wind project is also being built and is expected online in 2021.

There are also plans for a 50MW solar project, as well as an existing 70MW portfolio of hydro power.

The focus on renewables was spurred by the World Bank’s decision not to support a new coal-power plan in October 2018.

""World Bank data indicates that Kosovo can achieve around a 30% capacity factor for onshore wind in the north and east of the country, and a 16% capacity factor for solar, implying around 430GWh of electricity generation annually from the above-mentioned wind and solar projects, operating, planned or under construction,"" said IEEFA energy finance consultant Gerard Wynn.

""That is already starting to eat into the 2,370GWh generation theoretically available from a proposed new coal plant with 450MW net capacity, if that is assumed to run at the same 60% capacity factor as historically achieved at the country’s existing 960MW of coal-fired capacity,"" Wynn added."	https://www.windpowermonthly.com/article/1663679/kosovo-looks-renewables-revolution

operation	"Competitive Power Ventures (CPV) and Osaka Gas announced Tuesday that the CPV Fairview Energy Center (CPV Fairview) in Jackson Township near Johnstown, Pa., a 1,050-megawatt (MW) natural gas and ethane-fueled combined-cycle electric power plant, began full commercial operation.

CPV developed and managed the $1 billion project. It uses GE equipment and was constructed with union labor through local and national contractors Kiewit, Charles J. Merlo, Laurel Management and Cenergy. More than 600 workers were employed in the construction of the plant.

“Thanks to the outstanding team effort with our partner Osaka Gas USA and Kiewit our construction contractor, with General Electric as major equipment supplier, the CPV Fairview Energy Center is now fully operational on budget and significantly ahead of schedule,” CPV CEO Gary Lambert said. “CPV continues to make strides toward modernizing the country’s electric generation supply and improving reliability while addressing sustainability concerns by lowering systemwide emissions, including carbon, by deploying the most efficient technology with the cleanest fuel available – natural gas.”

CPV Fairview uses GE’s 7HA.02 gas turbines, a steam turbine, generators, and additional controls equipment. The plant, which is located on an 86-acre former brownfield site remediated and cleaned up by Neumeyer Environmental Services, uses industrial raw water from the Cambria Somerset Authority (CSA) for non-contact cooling purposes. The industrial raw water will be returned to CSA as reclaimed water for further potential industrial use.

“When companies are willing to invest over $1 billion in our communities, it demonstrates that Pennsylvania is open for business,” state Sen. Wayne Langerholc, Jr. (R-Bedford/Cambria/Clearfield) said. “CPV has been an excellent partner for our state and the local community. Having low cost, reliable power will help attract even more economic development to the area.”"	https://pennbizreport.com/news/14952-cpv-fairview-energy-center-in-jackson-township-begins-operations/?amp
operation	"RENO, Nev, Nov. 06, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ormat Technologies, Inc.1 (NYSE: ORA) today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2019.

“We continue to deliver on our stated goals of growing revenues and expanding gross margin,” commented Isaac Angel, Chief Executive Officer. “Total revenues increased 2.4%, driven by strong growth of 6.1% in our core Electricity revenues, which helped to offset both the lack of revenues from our Puna plant in Hawaii (which is preparing to re-start operations after the damage from the 2018 eruption of the Kilauea volcano), as well as the expected quarterly decline in our Product segment revenues. These strong results demonstrate the overall robustness of our Electricity segment and the benefit of our diversified portfolio of operations. Our gross margins also expanded on a year-over-year basis due to the positive impacts of our initiatives to improve plant-level efficiencies and to increase the geographic diversification of our Product segment into higher-margin territories.”

Mr. Angel continued, “The reconstruction efforts at Puna are on schedule and we expect our refurbishment activities will be completed by the end of the year, enabling us to deliver energy from the plant. All of our insurers have now started paying the costs to rebuild the damaged power plant equipment. However, certain insurers rejected our claim for business interruption coverage, and we have filed a lawsuit against these insurers. These lawsuits will not impact our plans for re-starting the Puna facility, and we expect to be able to sell the electricity produced at Puna as soon as the relevant permits required from local authorities for the operation of the substation and the transmission network upgrades being undertaken by our partners at Hawaii Electric Light Company (HELCO) are received. These are expected by the end of Q1 2020, and so we expect to be able to bring the power plant back to operation promptly thereafter, and to gradually increase the power plant’s generating capacity as we complete wellfield drilling work, with a target of regaining full operation by the end of the second quarter of 2020.”

“In the product segment, we are working on new opportunities in New Zealand, Indonesia and the Philippines to diversify and grow our backlog.” continued Mr. Angel. “We remain on pace to meet our full-year targets in all segments and expect to continue our growth path in 2020”

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019

Total revenues of $170.5 million, up 2.4% compared to the third quarter of 2018;

Recent Developments

Announced the commercial operation of the Hinesburg Battery Energy Storage System (Hinesburg BESS) under an agreement with Vermont Electric Cooperative (VEC).





Entered a partnership agreement with a private investor that acquired membership interests in the McGinness Hills phase 3 power plant to receive substantially all of the plant’s tax attributes for an initial purchase price of approximately $59.3 million.

2019 GUIDANCE

Mr. Angel added, “We are raising our 2019 Revenue guidance to the upper end of the range and increasing Adjusted EBITDA guidance. Excluding Puna, we expect full-year 2019 total revenues of between $731 million and $743 million, with Electricity segment revenues between $535 million and $540 million, and Product segment revenues between $185 million and $190 million. Revenues from our energy storage services business are expected to be between $11 million and $13 million. We expect 2019 Adjusted EBITDA to be between $385 million and $390 million. We expect annual Adjusted EBITDA attributable to minority interest to be approximately $23 million. This guidance, with regard to revenues, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA attributable to minority interest, excludes any contribution and/or impact from Puna.”

The Company provides a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure for the three months ended September 30, 2019. However, the Company is unable to provide a reconciliation for its Adjusted EBITDA guidance range due to high variability and complexity with respect to estimating forward looking amounts for impairments and disposition and acquisition of business interests, income taxes expense related to still evolving effects of the tax law reform in the United States and other non-cash expenses and adjusting items which are excluded from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA.

THIRD QUARTER 2019 FINANCIAL RESULTS (COMPARING THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 TO THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018)

Total revenues for the quarter were $170.5 million, up 2.4% compared to the same quarter last year. Electricity segment revenues increased 6.1% to $124.0 million, up from $116.9 million last year. The increase was mainly attributable to the commencement of commercial operation of the third phase of the McGinness Hills Complex in Nevada, effective December 2018, which generated total complex revenues of $20.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019 compared to $12.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018. Product segment revenues decreased 11.2% to $43.0 million, down from $48.4 million in the same quarter last year. Other segment revenues were $3.5 million compared to $1.2 million in the same quarter last year. The increase was mainly driven by the start of operation of two storage energy facilities in the PJM market.

General and administrative expenses were $11.9 million, or 7.0% of total revenues, compared to $13.6 million, or 8.2% of total revenues. This decrease was mainly related to a decrease in professional fees.

Net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders was $15.6 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, compared to $10.6 million, or $0.21 per diluted share.

Adjusted EBITDA5 was $85.5 million, compared to $75.6 million. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA is mainly related to the commencement of commercial operation of the third phase of the McGinness Hills Complex. A reconciliation of GAAP net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is set forth below in this release.

DIVIDEND

On November 6, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors declared, approved and authorized payment of a quarterly dividend of $0.11 per share pursuant to the Company’s dividend policy. The dividend will be paid on December 4, 2019 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 20, 2019.

Reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA

For the Three- and Nine-Month Periods Ended September 30, 2019 and 2018

(Unaudited)

We calculate EBITDA as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for (i) termination fees, (ii) impairment of long-lived assets, (iii) write-off of unsuccessful exploration activities, (iv) any mark-to-market gains or losses from accounting for derivatives, (v) merger and acquisition transaction costs, (vi) stock-based compensation, (vii) gain from extinguishment of liability, and (viii) gain on sale of subsidiary and property, plant and equipment. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not a measurement of financial performance or liquidity under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or as a measure of liquidity or an alternative to net earnings as indicators of our operating performance or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are presented because we believe they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of a Company’s ability to service and/or incur debt. However, other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do.

The following table reconciles net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2019 and 2018.

operation	"RIBBON CUTTING CEREMONY TO BE HELD ON OCTOBER 24, 2019



RENO, Nev., Oct. 24, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ormat Technologies, Inc.1 (NYSE: ORA) today announced the commercial operation of the Hinesburg Battery Energy Storage System (Hinesburg BESS) under an agreement with Vermont Electric Cooperative (VEC). The project is a collaborative effort between our wholly owned subsidiary, Viridity Energy Solutions, Inc. (Viridity), VEC, and WEG Electric Corp (WEG). A ribbon cutting ceremony to officially mark the launch of Hinesburg BESS is scheduled for 3p.m. on October 24, 2019 at the project site, which is located at 1121 Pond Brook Road Hinesburg, Vermont.

Through an innovative partnership structure, Viridity teamed with WEG to compete for the project via a competitive RFP process and was selected to develop and install the BESS in the fall of 2017.

“We brought together the best products, services and engineering talent to deliver a battery energy storage system that will provide cost and reliability benefits to VEC and its customers for years to come,” commented Isaac Angel, Chief Executive Officer. “The system, which was delivered according to the agreed upon schedule, not only supplies up to 4 megawatt hours of energy at peak consumption times, but also provides much needed ancillary services to the region's power grid. We are proud to bring on-line our first BESS project in New England, as part of our strategy to develop, own and operate energy storage facilities in several key US markets, also including PJM, Texas and California.”

Under the terms of the agreement with VEC, Ormat via Viridity built, owns and operates the lithium battery energy storage system and will provide coincident peak load reduction services to VEC over a minimum term of 10 years. Now in commercial operation, Viridity schedules, dispatches, monitors and supports the system 24 hours a day, 365 days a year to achieve VEC’s and Ormat’s mutual business objectives. The Hinesburg BESS increases flexibility for VEC, allowing it to draw power from the battery during peak demand times to reduce VEC’s transmission costs and also help stabilize fluctuations in voltage and frequency as the supply and demand for electricity varies. VEC and its customers benefit from the peak load management services while Ormat benefits from generating revenues by operating the system in the merchant markets managed by the New England Independent System Operator (ISONE).

WEG’s Vermont based energy storage business unit served as system integrator and equipment supplier providing a turnkey solution that interfaces with Viridity’s on-site energy management system and remote network operations center. WEG’s inverters and controls are integrated with Samsung lithium batteries and balance of system components at the VEC owned site, which is adjacent to VEC’s Hinesburg substation. WEG also provided overall engineering and construction, testing and commissioning services of the Hinesburg BESS and is currently providing operations and maintenance related services.

The system is sized to provide a guaranteed 1MW discharge during one to four hours per forecasted event over the ten-year agreement.

“Energy storage as a service, where utilities and other customers can avoid a capital investment, and only pay for the benefits received will be an enabler for rapid deployment on the grid, similar to what was done in the solar industry over the last 10 years,” remarked Chris McKay, Director of Sales for WEG’s BESS business. “We’re proud that our Vermont based engineering and project team was able to execute for a local utility like VEC through our partnership with Ormat via Viridity.”

“Storage is a key part of the energy transformation that is now thoroughly underway to ensure an affordable and reliable grid,” said Rebecca Towne, CEO of Vermont Electric Cooperative. “This one megawatt battery is VEC’s first utility-scale storage project and it is already helping VEC save up to $100,000 per year by reducing peak loads. It will also help to reduce regional carbon emissions during peak times when the grid relies on dirtier, fossil-fuel powered generators across New England. We are proud of this project and appreciate this successful partnership with WEG and Viridity.”

Spanish energy giant Iberdrola has commissioned the largest PV plant in Europe – the 500 MW Núñez de Balboa project – following the completion of construction in December 2019.

The €300 million project, which went into operation on Monday, is located between the municipalities of Usagre, Hinojosa del Valle, and Bienvenida, in southern Spain’s Extremadura region. Iberdrola developed it in partnership with local power provider Ecoenergías del Guadiana. It features 1,430,000 solar panels, 115 central inverters, and two substations.

Iberdrola managed to secure green financing from the European Investment Bank and Spain’s Official Credit Institute. It signed a PPA with Uvesco (BM Supermarcados) covering 391 MW of the project’s total capacity in November 2018, following the finalization of an initial PPA that it signed with financial services provider Kutxabank in July, in addition to another one signed in mid-October with telecoms service provider Euskaltel, which is based in Basque Country.

Iberdrola plans to install 3 GW of solar until 2022, of which 2 GW will be located in Extremadura. By 2030, the company aims to deploy approximately 10 GW. In June, it revealed plans to build two installations with a total capacity of 800 MW of solar near Cuenca, in Spain’s central-southern region of Castilla-La Mancha."	https://www.pv-magazine.com/2020/04/08/europes-largest-solar-park-now-online/
operation	"RENO, Nev. , Feb. 25, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ormat Technologies, Inc. (the “Company”, “we”, “Ormat” or “us”) (NYSE: ORA) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2019 and a transition of its senior management.

MANAGEMENT TRANSITIONS

Mr. Angel has decided to retire from his position as Chief Executive Officer, effective July 1, 2020, after six years of successful service to the Company, its employees and its shareholders. It is intended that Mr. Angel will become a member of Ormat’s Board of Directors before his retirement as Chief Executive Officer and will continue to be employed by the Company through December 31, 2020 in order to assist with the management transition.

Ormat’s Board of Directors has appointed Mr. Blachar, the Company’s President and Chief Financial Officer, to succeed Mr. Angel. Mr. Blachar will assume the role of Chief Executive Officer on July 1, 2020 upon Mr. Angel’s retirement.

The Board is confident that the Company will reach new heights under Doron’s leadership. Doron has been a strategic executive with a deep understanding of our industry and how to grow our business profitably. He has proven invaluable over the past seven years. Finally, we welcome Assaf Ginzburg to the Ormat team.”

“This was a positive ending to a strong year for Ormat,” commented Mr. Angel, Chief Executive Officer. “With the encouraging regulatory environment, robust growth plan and increasing market demand for base-load renewable energy, Ormat is well-positioned for continued success in 2020 and beyond. Our electricity segment delivered 6.0% full-year growth despite no contribution by Puna for all of 2019 and we signed three important PPAs in Hawaii and California, giving us great visibility into the coming year. We now expect Puna to re-start operations in the second half of 2020 due to a delay in a building permit that was received just last week. In the product segment, we are close to signing a significant contract that, if signed, would replenish our backlog. Our storage and management services segment is growing, and as customers continue to seek innovative ways to improve efficiency of renewable energy systems through storage, we believe that this portion of our business will become increasingly relevant.”

Mr. Angel continued, “Confidence in our business is growing with the recent extension of federal tax incentives, which supports our accelerated growth plans in the U.S. Today, we announce our 2022 growth targets, which projects the addition of 180MW to 200MW of new megawatts of generating capacity from geothermal and solar by the end of 2022 and are in an advance stage of securing a new operating and development pipeline of energy storage projects, demonstrating progress towards our stated goal to evolve from a geothermal leader to a leader in renewable energy. This evolution ties nicely with our energy storage efforts, positioning Ormat as an industry leader with a comprehensive range of products, solutions, properties and expertise to deliver clean, renewable energy in a variety of ways.”

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

Ormat signed two similar 10-year PPAs with Silicon Valley Clean Energy (SVCE) and Monterey Bay Community Power (MBCP), under which SVCE and MBCP will each purchase 7MW (for a total of 14MW) of power generated by the expected 30MW Casa Diablo-IV (CD4) geothermal project located in Mammoth Lakes, California.





Ormat’s subsidiary, Puna Geothermal Venture (PGV), and Hawaiian Electric’s Hawaii Electric Light amended and restated a PPA for dispatchable geothermal power sold from Ormat’s Puna complex, located on the Big Island of Hawaii through 2052. The PPA increased contracted capacity under the agreement and provided for new fixed prices, regardless of changes to fossil fuel pricing.





The United States federal government retroactively revived and extended the full Production Tax Credit (PTC) for geothermal facilities through 2020. The PTC provides a credit for each kilowatt-hour of energy produced by the taxpayer from qualified renewable energy facilities.





Ormat announced the commercial operation of the Hinesburg Battery Energy Storage System (Hinesburg BESS) under an agreement with Vermont Electric Cooperative (VEC).





Ormat announced the appointment of Mr. Blachar as the Company’s President. Mr. Blachar is assisting the Chief Executive Officer, Isaac Angel, with the Company’s strategic direction and operational management until he assumes Mr. Angel’s position in July 1, 2020.

2020 GUIDANCE

Mr. Angel added, “We expect full-year 2020 total revenues of between $720 million and $740 million with electricity segment revenues between $560 million and $570 million. We expect product segment revenues of between $140 million and $150 million. Revenues from energy storage and demand response activity are expected to be between $15 million and $20 million. We expect 2020 Adjusted EBITDA of between $405 million and $415 million for the full year. We expect annual Adjusted EBITDA attributable to minority interest to be approximately $26 million.”

The Company provides a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure for the three months and year ended December 31, 2019. However, the Company is unable to provide a reconciliation for its Adjusted EBITDA guidance range due to high variability and complexity with respect to estimating forward looking amounts for impairments and disposition and acquisition of business interests, income taxes expense related to still evolving effects of the tax law reform in the United States and other non-cash expenses and adjusting items that are excluded from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA.

FOURTH QUARTER 2019 FINANCIAL RESULTS (COMPARING THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 TO THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018)

Total revenues for the quarter were $192.4 million, up 1.0% compared to the same quarter last year. Electricity segment revenues increased 4.4% to $144.4 million, up from $138.3 million last year. The increase was mainly attributable to the commencement of commercial operation of the third phase of the McGinness Hills Complex in Nevada, which began in December 2018. Product segment revenues decreased 11.9% to $43.8 million, down from $49.7 million in the same quarter last year due to timing of revenue recognition of the projects included in our backlog. Energy Storage and Management Services segment revenues were $4.3 million compared to $2.4 million in the same quarter last year. The increase was mainly driven by the start of operation of two storage energy facilities in the PJM market.

General and administrative expenses were $14.0 million, or 7.3% of total revenues, compared to $4.4 million, or 2.3% of total revenues. The increase was primarily attributable to $10.3 million of income resulting from the release of an earn-out provision related to the acquisition of our Viridity business that offset expenses in the year ended December 31, 2018. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2018 constituted 7.7% of total revenues for such period excluding the earn-out adjustment.

Net income attributable to the Company’s shareholders was $12.6 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, compared to $18.2 million, or $0.36 per diluted share.

Adjusted EBITDA4 was $102.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 and $104.7 million excluding the impact of Puna that was shutdown following the volcanic eruption in 2018, compared to $113.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and $103.6 million excluding the impact of Puna. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA without the impact of Puna is mainly related to the commencement of commercial operation of the third phase of the McGinness Hills Complex. A reconciliation of GAAP net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is set forth below in this release.

FULL YEAR 2019 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

For the year ended December 31, 2019, total revenues were $746.0 million, up from $719.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of 3.7%. Electricity segment revenues increased 6.0% to $540.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, up from $509.9 million for 2018. Product segment revenues decreased 5.3% to $191.0 million for the year, down from $201.7 million last year. Energy Storage and Management Services segment revenues were $14.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $7.6 million in 2018.

General and administrative expenses for the full year of 2019 were $55.8 million, or 7.5% of total revenues, compared to $47.8 million, or 6.6% of total revenues last year. This increase was mainly due to a $10.3 million adjustment in respect to an earn out related to the acquisition of the Viridity business in 2018, which was partially offset by costs related to the identification of a material weakness related to taxes in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the restatement of 2017 financial statements and costs related to the acquisition of USG.

Net income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $93.5 million compared to $110.1 million for the prior year period.

Net income attributable to the company’s stockholders was $88.1 million, or $1.72 per diluted share, compared to $98.0 million, or $1.92 per diluted share, for the same period a year ago.

Adjusted Net income attributable to the Company's stockholders4 for 2019 of $74.8 million, or $1.46 per diluted share. Adjusted net income attributable to the company's stockholders and diluted EPS for 2018 of $106.1 million or, $2.08 per diluted share.

Adjusted EBITDA4 for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $384.3 million and $385.5 excluding the impact of Puna that was shutdown following the volcanic eruption in 2018, compared to $368.0 million for 2018 and $354.7 million, respectively, an increase of 8.7% in the Adjusted EBITDA without the impact of Puna. The reconciliation of GAAP Net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is set forth below in this release.

DIVIDEND

On February 25, 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors declared, approved and authorized payment of a quarterly dividend of $0.11 per share pursuant to the Company’s dividend policy. The dividend will be paid on March 26, 2020 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 12, 2020. In addition, the Company expects to pay a quarterly dividend of $0.11 per share in each of the next three quarters.

Reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA

For the Three- and 12-Month Periods Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018

We calculate EBITDA as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for (i) termination fees, (ii) impairment of long-lived assets, (iii) write-off of unsuccessful exploration activities, (iv) any mark-to-market gains or losses from accounting for derivatives, (v) merger and acquisition transaction costs, (vi) stock-based compensation, (vii) gain or loss from extinguishment of liabilities, (viii) gain or loss on sale of subsidiary and property, plant and equipment and (ix) other unusual or non-recurring items. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of financial performance or liquidity under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or as a measure of liquidity or an alternative to net earnings as indicators of our operating performance or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a performance metric because it is a metric used by our Board of Directors and senior management in evaluating our financial performance. However, other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do.

The following table reconciles net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the three and 12-month periods ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.

operation	"Iberdrola’s 500MW Núñez de Balboa solar plant in Spain, claimed to be the largest photovoltaic plant in Europe has come into operation just one year after construction commenced.

The plant involved an investment of close to €300 million ($329 million), financed by the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the Instituto de Crédito Oficial (ICO), Spain’s state financial agency for the project.

The plant, says Iberdrola, will supply energy to major clients in the banking, telecommunications and distribution sectors through long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs).

operation	"Golar LNG Limited (""Golar"") announces today that Golar Power Limited (""Golar Power""), a joint venture with Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners, has reached COD on the 1.5GW Porto de Sergipe I Power Project (the ""Project"").

On March 21 Golar Power received its commercial operations certificate from ANEEL (Brazilian Electricity Regulatory Agency). This allows commercial operations to commence at the 1.5GW Sergipe power station. The first integrated LNG-to-power project in Brazil and the largest and most efficient thermal power station in Latin America, the Project also includes a dedicated LNG import and regasification terminal using the Golar Nanook, a newbuild FSRU with 170,000m3 of LNG storage capable of supplying more than 21.0 million m3 per day of natural gas.

The project revolutionizes the way power is delivered to millions of people in Brazil, allowing the country to meet its growing requirement for base-load capacity using a large-scale power plant fuelled by cleaner and more reliable LNG. This important achievement will facilitate Brazil’s transition to lower-carbon energy generation sources whilst also promoting the use of LNG to balance and diversify its supply of energy.

Golar LNG (GLNG) owns 25% of the power station through its 50% investment in Golar Power. In 2015 the Project was awarded 25-year 1.5GW power purchase agreements at the government promoted A-5 Power Auction. The power station will now start to deliver electricity to a pool of 26 power distribution companies across the country until December 2044.

Under the terms of the PPAs, the Project has guaranteed annual capacity payments of approximately BRL1.6 billion, adjusted annually for local inflation, together with pass-through of fuel and operating costs according to dispatch. Annual revenues less forecasted operating costs are estimated at BRL1.1 billion. Revenues less forecasted operating costs over the life of the project, without inflation adjustment, are expected to amount to BRL27.5 billion, of which Golar LNG’s 25% share is BRL 6.9 billion, equivalent to USD 1.7 billion based on an average 2019 BRL/USD FX rate of 3.95. Approximately 94% of the long-term financing raised for the project is denominated in local currency (BRL).

Commencement of power plant operations also triggered the start of bareboat charter payments for the 100% Golar Power owned FSRU Golar Nanook. Annual revenues less forecasted operating costs, of $43.9 million, adjusted annually for inflation based on US CPI, are expected. Revenues less forecasted operating costs over the life of the Nanook contract without further inflation adjustment are estimated at USD1.1 billion, of which Golar LNG’s 50% share is expected to be USD549 million. Further upside can be expected from the downstream LNG distribution business that will be developed using the significant spare capacity on board the FSRU.

operation	"Spanish renewable power giant Iberdrola has completed work on what it claims is the largest solar project ever built in Europe.

The 500-megawatt Núñez de Balboa facility is now undergoing testing with Spanish grid operator Red Eléctrica de España (REE) and is expected to be in full commercial operation this quarter.

Europe's previous largest project was the 300-megawatt Cestas, built by Neoen in the south of France. But the latest record might not stand for long with Iberdrola planning the 590-megawatt Francisco Pizarro project in Spain. Completion is expected in 2022.

Iberdrola, among the world's largest wind generators, has a series of power-purchase agreements (PPAs) in place for Núñez de Balboa. These include a 10-year deal with Kutxabank to power its operations. Telecommunications firm Euskaltel and the Uvesco supermarket chain are also signed up.

Modules for the project were supplied by a trio of Chinese manufacturers: Suntech, Longi and GCL-SI. The total investment for the entire project was €290 million ($325 million).

All of the financing was provided the European Investment Bank and the Instituto de Crédito Oficial, a Spanish state-owned bank.

Iberdrola is planning to install 3,000 megawatts of solar capacity in Spain by 2022 and a total of 10 gigawatts of renewables by 2030. The company is active in a variety of renewable markets around the world, including the U.S., where it is among the country's largest wind operators through its Avangrid subsidiary.

Spanish solar rebound

Spain is experiencing a surge in solar development, largely driven by PPAs and other post-subsidy routes to market. The late-stage project pipeline at the end of 2019 was nudging 9 gigawatts, according to Wood Mackenzie.

Spain’s solar market has been the focus of massive speculation, with REE canceling 20.5 gigawatts of grid applications that were not progressing. Developers cite the grid queue as the major roadblock to further progress in the country.

In addition to the previous size record holder, the 300-megawatt Cestas plant in France, a series of similarly sized projects are going through a lengthy national planning process in the U.K. The largest subsidy-free project, also in Spain, was BayWa r.e.’s Don Rodrigo site weighing in at 175 megawatts.

As Europe’s solar market shifts away from subsidies, developers are increasingly chasing the lowest levelized cost of electricity and looking to exploit economies of scale. Where subsidized projects are typically a few dozen megawatts in Europe, an increasing number of triple-digit capacities are appearing in project pipelines.

In th U.K., the Cleve Hill development will link a 300-megawatt solar park with substantial energy storage. The Little Crow Solar Park is slated to reach 150 megawatts. The U.K.’s largest subsidy-free project is the 50-megawatt site at Staughton.

EnBW has approved a 180-megawatt subsidy-free project in Germany.

Total solar installations in Europe doubled in 2019 compared to the previous year, with further growth anticipated, according to research by SolarPower Europe. In the trade group's most optimistic scenario, 2019’s tally of 16.7 gigawatts could double to 35 gigawatts in 2022.

operation	"Brazilian electricity regulator Aneel has given the go-ahead for the start of commercial operations at the country’s first integrated LNG-to-power project, developer Golar Power said this week.

With the commercial operations clearance Golar Power – a 50-50 joint venture between Golar LNG and Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners – can commence the 1,500-megawatt (MW) Sergipe power station, Kallanish Energy reports.

The plant is also the largest and most efficient thermal power station in Latin America. The project includes a dedicated LNG import and regasification terminal – the newbuild floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU) Golar Nanook.

The FSRU has capacity to supply over 21 million cubic meter per day of natural gas, promoting the use of liquefied natural gas to balance and diversify the energy mix.

operation	"Total operating revenues of $139 million for Q4 2019, cash generation ramping up

Iain Ross, CEO, Golar LNG, said:

""We are pleased to announce a strong 4Q result, with total operating revenue generation up $40.4 million to $139.0 million. Comprising revenue from FLNG Hilli Episeyo, which delivered yet another quarter of 100% uptime, and shipping, which achieved a fleet Average daily TCE1 of $77,000 per day, the 41% improvement in operating revenues was driven by a seasonal upturn in shipping rates as well as an increased focus on charter coverage across the fleet. Through a combination of fixed and floating rate charters, Golar has secured charter coverage for 62% of its 2020 available shipping days.

The 1.55GW Sergipe power plant in Brazil, now in the final stages of hot commissioning, is on track, with scheduled commencement of operations towards the end of 1Q 2020. All three turbines have been successfully tested and the plant is currently producing and selling power to the grid.

The wave of new liquefaction coming on stream has caused LNG prices to soften further. Together with its environmental advantages, this has further strengthened the attractiveness of LNG relative to other energy sources. Golar Power is actively pursuing opportunities to capture this advantage through its downstream initiatives, including:

Production of merchant power through the Sergipe power plant in non-dispatch periods.

Utilization of the spare capacity on FSRU Golar Nanook.

Its award and development of the 605MW Barcarena power plant and LNG import terminal.

Roll-out of small-scale LNG distribution using small-scale shipping and ISO containers.

The recently announced partnership with BR Distribuidora.

These initiatives are significant beneficiaries of low LNG prices. Most require minimal levels of capex, but have the potential to materially increase Golar's short-to-medium term earnings.

Golar is now fully funded. Further strong growth in revenues can be expected as key infrastructure assets in Golar Power and the FLNG Gimi become operational. Additional upside can be achieved by releasing invested equity through optimized post-delivery financing. By integrating the LNG value chain, Golar is in a unique position to allocate capital to that part of the chain that is best positioned to generate the highest return in the prevailing LNG price environment. The company is committed to capital discipline, to the simplification of its corporate structure, and to using its $6.6 billion of committed contract earnings backlog1 and unique strategic position to maximize shareholder returns.""

Outlook

Golar Power:

The Sergipe power station Commercial Operations Date is expected before the end of 1Q, triggering acceptance of the Nanook FSRU contract as well as the PPA agreements. Golar’s interest in these 25-year contracts is worth approximately $99 million in annual forecast Adjusted EBITDA1. The Barcarena power plant and terminal project is also progressing well, with significant progress made on FSRU selection and power plant financing. A Final Investment Decision (""FID"") for the Barcarena project is expected this year.

Near-record low LNG prices continue to add momentum to downstream distribution discussions with customers around Sergipe, Barcarena and a third terminal currently in the advanced stages of permitting. The partnership with BR Distribuidora will accelerate access to infrastructure and licenses, allowing for the installation of LNG-specific distribution plant and equipment to service downstream customers.

FLNG:

Low spot LNG prices, an increasing focus on the environment, and our industry leading operational track record are attracting oil major and national oil company project developers to our low cost, small footprint FLNG solutions. Work on a standardized newbuild FLNG solution to be built in an Asian yard is progressing well.

LNG Shipping:

Golar has fixed most of its fleet on charters that will run throughout the low season. Based on fixtures to date, 1Q 2020 TCE1 is anticipated to be around $60,000 per day, substantially higher than the $39,300 achieved for 1Q 2019. Except for the FSRU Tundra, currently trading as an LNGC, all TFDE vessels have now completed their scheduled five-year dry-dockings and all are currently on charter. Relative to 2019, when eight vessels were dry-docked, 2020 will see only one vessel dry-dock, increasing potential 2020 vessel earning capacity by more than 250 days. New demand for LNG in 2020 is likely to come from Korea, which is shutting multiple coal fired power stations, Japan where a number of nuclear plants are scheduled to be taken offline for modifications and from ongoing global coal-to-gas switching and small-scale LNG distribution projects.

Despite the market uncertainties associated with Covid-19, US-China trade discussions and normal seasonality fluctuations, Golar remains focused on fleet utilization and longer-term relationships with charterers.

(2) The line item ""Realized and unrealized gain on oil derivative instrument"" relating to income from the FLNG Hilli Episeyo Liquefaction Tolling Agreement is split into, ""Realized gain on oil derivative instrument"" and ""Unrealized gain/(loss) on oil derivative instrument"". The unrealized component represents a mark-to-market gain of $4.3 million (September 30, 2019: $44.2 million loss) on the oil embedded derivative, which represents the estimate of expected receipts under the remainder of the Brent oil linked clause of the Hilli Episeyo Liquefaction Tolling Agreement. The realized component amounts to $1.1 million (September 30, 2019: $4.6 million) and represents the income in relation to the Hilli Episeyo Liquefaction Tolling Agreement receivable in cash.

Golar reports today 4Q operating income of $68.9 million compared to losses of $13.7 million in 3Q.

Total operating revenues increased from $98.7 million in 3Q to $139.0 million in 4Q, while voyage, charterhire and commission expenses decreased from $5.6 million to $2.3 million. The improvement in both was largely the result of a stronger shipping market, but also due to fewer vessel dry-docks and associated positioning off-hire days.

Revenues from vessel and other operations, including management fee income, was $84.5 million and, net of voyage, charterhire and commission expenses, increased by $43.7 million to $82.2 million in 4Q. Assisted by the start-up of new liquefaction trains, US sanctions on a vessel owner, inventory building and use of vessels for floating storage, rates continued to strengthen throughout the first half of the quarter. By late October, there were no prompt available vessels and TFDE spot rates peaked at around $130k per day. Rates then trended down with LNG prices, and the year ended with spot TFDE rates at around $90k per day. Utilization increased from 65% in 3Q to 90% in 4Q, with full fleet TCE1 earnings increasing accordingly from $35,200 in 3Q to $77,000 in 4Q. Despite improving rates, revenue continued to be negatively impacted by positioning and scheduled dry-docking of the last two of eight TFDE carriers.

Once again, FLNG Hilli Episeyo generated operating revenues of $54.5 million, including base tolling fees and amortization of pre-acceptance amounts recognized.

Vessel operating expenses at $30.8 million in 4Q were $2.4 million higher than 3Q. Most of the increase is attributable to costs incurred during one of 2019's two scheduled FLNG Hilli Episeyo maintenance windows.

At $11.8 million for the quarter, total administrative expenses were $0.8 million lower than 3Q due to lower departmental and share option costs.

The Brent Oil linked component of Hilli Episeyo's fees generates additional annual operating cash flows of approximately $3 million for every dollar increase in Brent Crude prices between $60.00 per barrel and the contractual ceiling. Billing of this component is based on a three-month look-back at average Brent Crude prices. Lower oil prices led to a $3.5 million decrease in the realized gain on the oil derivative instrument, down from $4.6 million in 3Q to $1.1 million in 4Q.

The mark-to-market fair value of the derivative asset increased by $4.3 million during the quarter, with a corresponding unrealized gain of the same amount recognized in the income statement. The fair value increase was driven by an upward movement in the expected future market price for Brent Oil. The spot price for Brent Oil increased from $60.78 per barrel on September 30 to $66.00 on December 31.

Other operating gains and losses included a $1.2 million gain in 4Q following the receipt of further proceeds from a 2018 loss-of-hire claim for Golar Viking (compared to a gain of $2.8 million in 3Q in respect of the same claim).

Depreciation and amortization at $28.3 million in 4Q was in line with the previous quarter.

Net Income Summary:

2019 2019 (in thousands of $) Oct-Dec Jul-Sep Operating income/(loss) 68,896 (13,666) Interest income 1,333 2,709 Interest expense (14,140) (23,368) Losses on derivative instruments (6) (17,619) Other financial items, net (1,206) (978) Income taxes (369) (274) Equity in net earnings/(losses) of affiliates 1,831 (7,761) Net income attributable to non-controlling interests (31,571) (21,344) Net income/(loss) attributable to Golar LNG Limited 24,768 (82,301)

In 4Q, the group generated net income of $24.8 million, compared to a 3Q net loss of $82.3 million. Key items contributing to this are:

A reduction in VIE interest expense due to capitalization of deferred finance charges previously expensed accounts for most of the $9.2 million decrease in interest expense.

A loss on the 1.5 million TRS shares repurchased during 4Q was offset by a gain on the remaining 1.5 million shares due to an increase in the share price. During 3Q, a loss of $17.6 million was recorded in respect of the 3.0 million TRS shares outstanding as at September 30.

The $1.8 million 4Q equity in net earnings of affiliates primarily comprised the following: A $7.4 million earnings in respect of Golar's 32% share in Golar Partners; A $5.1 million loss in respect of Golar's 50% stake in Golar Power; and A $0.7 million loss in respect of Golar's 22.5% stake in Avenir.



Net income attributable to non-controlling interests represents external interests in the Hilli Episeyo and the finance lease variable interest entities (""VIEs"").

Financing and Liquidity:

Golar’s total cash position as at December 31 was $440.6 million (including restricted cash), of which $222.1 million was unrestricted. Included within restricted cash is $65.1 million relating to lessor-owned VIEs, $55.6 million of collateral in respect of the TRS and $76.0 million relating to the Hilli Episeyo LC. During the quarter, Perenco and SNH agreed to a reduction in the Hilli Episeyo LC requirement (with a proportionate decrease in the Perenco and SNH security). This resulted in the release of $75 million of restricted cash in November 2019.

During January 2020, the LNG carrier Golar Viking entered Hudong shipyard for FSRU conversion works. Upon yard entry, the existing $41.7 million vessel debt facility was refinanced by a CSSCFL facility that will also be available to cover conversion costs.

As at December 31, $434 million had been invested in FLNG Gimi, on a 100% basis. Having satisfied the initial equity investment threshold during 4Q, drawdowns against the $700 million debt facility have now commenced. As at 31 December, $130 million had been drawn down. Based on the current payment schedule, approximately $59 million is expected to be paid by Golar in 2020.

Included within the $1,070.5 million current portion of long-term debt and short-term debt on the Balance Sheet as at December 31 is $793.8 million relating to lessor-owned VIE subsidiaries that Golar is currently required to consolidate in connection with 8 sale and leaseback financed vessels, including the Hilli Episeyo.

Golar has now financed all of its projects under development and looks forward to substantial increases in contracted earnings over the next three years. Surplus cash will be applied to the most attractive use including further growth investments or share buybacks.

Corporate and Other Matters:

As at December 31, 2019, there were 99.3 million shares outstanding, excluding the remaining 1.5 million shares underlying the TRS and a further 0.5 million TRS shares purchased in January 2016 but not cancelled until February 2020. There were also 2.7 million outstanding stock options with an average price of $30.23 and 0.2 million Restricted Stock Units in issue. During 4Q, the Company purchased 1.5 million of the 3 million shares underlying the TRS. At a cash cost of $69.5 million, the purchase was satisfied by $54.7 million of restricted cash set aside as collateral and $14.8 million of unrestricted cash. The remaining 1.5 million TRS shares were purchased during February. Costing $70.5 million, $55.6 million was satisfied by the remaining restricted cash set aside as collateral, with the balance of $14.9 million funded out of unrestricted cash. Thereafter there will be 97.8 million shares outstanding.

Commercial Review

Golar Power (50/50 Golar/Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners non-consolidated downstream joint venture):

Barring any unforeseen issues, the Sergipe power plant is expected to commence commercial operations by the end of 1Q. There have been no significant problems to date, with any minor issues resolved quickly after identification. Commissioned and ready for service, the supporting FSRU Nanook is maintaining 100 bar pressure on the CNG line and the first ship to ship cargo transfer has been successfully completed. Current prices for LNG delivered into Brazil are below $3.0/mmbtu. At this price, power produced by the Sergipe powerplant costs approximately $22MWh. This creates significant potential for Golar Power to generate incremental earnings through sale of merchant power during non-dispatch periods.

Having been awarded a 25-year power purchase agreement for the construction of a 605MW combined cycle thermal power plant in Barcarena, efforts are now being made to secure additional industrial and small-scale users nearby. While the power project will be the anchor tenant for the FSRU, the economics of the project will be materially enhanced with additional users. FSRU selection and FID are expected to take place this year when many of these discussions should have concluded, allowing small-scale LNG distribution operations to commence in 2021, well ahead of the January 2025 power station start-up date. Golar's share of total capex for the power station, payable between 2022 and 2025, equates to $107 million.

In the State of Santa Catarina, Golar Power has received key regulatory and environmental licenses for a third FSRU terminal. An oil major developing a 600MW power plant is expected to be the anchor tenant, and Golar Power has the option to invest in the plant. There is also the ability to connect to and market gas to end users on the Bolivia-Brazil pipeline. Subject to the receipt of a few remaining licenses and permits, FID is expected by the end of 2020, and operations will potentially be able to commence in 2022. Rapid monetization of the Brazil downstream distribution business together with the reinvestment of cash generated by the Sergipe project would allow both projects to be taken forward without recourse to shareholders Golar and Stonepeak.

Golar Power continues to develop its small-scale distribution business and has in excess of 100 customers looking to move from MOUs to binding agreements for quantity and price of LNG supply. These customers will be supplied from spare capacity on the FSRU Nanook, capacity on the yet-to-be specified FSRUs expected to support the Barcarena and Santa Catarina projects and other terminal agreements currently under discussion. The supply chain to connect terminals to customers is now being assembled. Golar Power has agreed to charter a 7,500m3 LNG carrier from affiliate company Avenir, taken delivery of Iso Containers (for the transportation of LNG by road or barge) and is now implementing a mobile filling station concept that will supply LNG-fueled trucks.

On February 18, 2020, Golar Power and BR Distribuidora announced the formation of a partnership to develop an LNG distribution business in Brazil. A highly regarded brand with a nationwide presence serviced via a network of more than 7,600 fuel stations and 95 bases of supply, operation and distribution, BR Distribuidora can legitimately claim to be Brazil's leading fuel distribution company. As with Golar Power, BR Distribuidora believes that LNG is an innovative and potentially disruptive solution for the transportation sector in Brazil that delivers both environmental benefits and important economic gains for customers seeking cheaper, cleaner and more efficient alternatives to the fuels currently available. The partnership between Golar Power and BR Distribuidora foresees the use of the 95 supply, operation and distribution bases to initiate the rollout of LNG supply to Brazil's transportation and industrial sectors followed by use of the 7,600 fuel stations to increase coverage thereafter. A major user of road transport itself, BR Distribuidora also intends to replace its hired fleet of 5,000 trucks with vehicles that run on LNG.

Golar Power has established a leading position in Brazil's LNG revolution. As a country of approximately 210 million people with an existing fleet of 2.7 million diesel-fueled heavy vehicles, the addressable market for the transition to LNG is substantial.

FLNG:

FLNG Hilli Episeyo continues to achieve 100% commercial uptime and recently exported its 34th cargo.

The fully funded FLNG Gimi Conversion project continues in Singapore, where the vessel recently entered its third of five planned dry-dockings. Approximately 85 Golar personnel and in excess of 1,500 Keppel employees are now working daily on the project. While Covid-19 does have the potential to impact the supply chain, yard operations in Singapore are capably managing the situation and progress remains on target. Seventy percent owned FLNG Gimi will service the 20-year contract with BP offshore Mauritania and Senegal, commencing 4Q 2022.

Project development discussions continue to progress with other oil majors and national oil companies attracted by Golar's industry-leading technical and operational track record. Mindful of the long lead time to FID, followed by a four-year construction and commissioning period, the quickest a new FLNG would deliver new LNG to market is around five years from now.

As previously indicated, Golar has evaluated specific proposals from infrastructure funds for direct investments in its FLNG assets that would highlight the value created in FLNG projects. The company has however decided not to pursue these offers due to a combination of its improved financial position, long-term cash flow from FLNG projects and the opportunity to extract additional value and lower-cost financing post-delivery.

LNG Shipping:

The quarter commenced with LNG prices at around $5.40/mmbtu, quoted TFDE spot rates of around $100k per day and an expectation that new LNG supply and a smoother Chinese demand profile would dampen the customary increase in winter LNG prices. Supported by the start-up of new liquefaction trains, sanctions on a vessel owner, inventory building and contango, rates strengthened with TFDE rates reaching a 2019 peak of $130k per day in late October. Mild winter temperatures then began to mute the forces of market tightening by making it less likely that spot LNG prices would reach even the small gains implied by the forward curve. Limited remaining storage in Europe and pushback from buyers in Japan and China did, however, continue to absorb tonnage as vessels idled, diverted and slow steamed while waiting to discharge. As vessels began to discharge over the course of December, vessel availability then increased and rates softened. The year ended with rates at levels similar to the start of 2019 ($90k per day) and LNG prices where they started on October 1.

During 4Q, the Elba Island facility entered commercial service and the first commissioning cargo was shipped from Freeport T2, where commercial operations have since commenced. Based on the ramp-up profile of recently started facilities together with new facilities scheduled to commence, 30mtpa of additional liquefaction capacity is expected in 2020. Equating to vessel demand growth of approximately 17%, this is expected to outpace vessel supply growth of 8%. Although Covid-19 has impacted near-term Chinese LNG demand, prices and vessel spot rates, new demand into the shoulder season is expected from Korea and Japan, where coal and nuclear facilities are being taken out of service. Supported by low LNG prices and the waning influence of destination clauses, the LNG spot and short-term market should also continue to grow faster than the total market. This, together with already secured coverage, means that Golar continues to expect solid results from its shipping operations.

Golar Partners (a non-consolidated affiliate of Golar LNG):

Aided by an improved performance from LNG carriers Golar Maria and Golar Mazo, the fleet continued to perform well, with 4Q adjusted EBITDA1 marginally higher than 3Q despite the scheduled December downtime of the FSRU Golar Igloo. Further interest rate swap gains allowed the Partnership to report a $22.5 million increase in net income, up from $7.9 million in 3Q to $30.4 million in 4Q. Distribution coverage1 increased, from 1.18 in 3Q to 1.21 in 4Q.

A rapid tightening of the shipping market from the end of September meant that steam turbine vessels represented the only available tonnage on more than one occasion during 4Q. This enabled the Golar Maria to be fixed for several months at a higher rate and the Golar Mazo to be withdrawn from warm layup for a voyage charter. A further two-year charter for the Golar Maria starting in late 2020 was also secured. The charter includes options for the charterer to extend by a further 1+1+1 years. During February, current charterers of the Golar Grand agreed to extend their May maturing charter by a further year.

During 4Q, Kuwait National Petroleum Co. (""KNPC"") awarded the Partnership a two-year contract for the FSRU Golar Igloo. The contract provides for two years of continued LNG storage and regasification services in Kuwait for KNPC’s regasification seasons, the first of which commenced on February 24, 2020. This contract may be further extended by KNPC for a further year through to December 2022. Modifications necessary to increase both the regas capacity and operational efficiency of FSRU Golar Igloo are now complete. Golar Igloo has been fitted with a proprietary hydro energy system that, subject to confirmation by trial, can produce up to 1.2MW of clean energy, equivalent to a 7% system efficiency improvement or savings of around 5 tons of fuel per day when operating at full load. Golar Igloo frequently operates at full load, so this represents an attractive potential fuel saving for KNPC.

Lower global LNG prices have increased the relative attractiveness of FSRUs, enabling new markets to participate in the LNG fuel arbitrage and lower their cost of energy. This is expected to have a positive impact on future demand for FSRUs.

The Partnership continues to evaluate its structure and strategy in order to maximize long-term shareholder value while also ensuring that it is appropriately debt financed. This evaluation includes potential structured transactions to grow the Partnership, bond and bank debt refinancing and the ongoing pursuit of opportunities to redeploy the FSRU Golar Spirit and carrier Golar Mazo. Future distribution levels will be determined by the relative success of the above as well as the level and terms of new financing and growth capital requirements.

Non-US GAAP Measures Used in Forecasting

Contract Earnings Backlog: Contract earnings backlog represents Golar's share of contracted fee income for executed contracts less forecasted operating expenses for these contracts. In calculating forecasted operating expenditure, management has assumed that where there is an Operating Services Agreement the amount receivable under the services agreement will cover the associated operating costs. For contracts which do not have a separate Operating Services Agreement, management has made an assumption about operating costs based on the current run rate. The only material application of this methodology was to the Hilli Episeyo Earnings backlog where we assumed operating costs of approximately $120,000 per day.

For consolidated subsidiaries where we do not own 100% of the share capital, management has only included our proportionate share of contract earnings. The material application of this assumption was to Gimi (70% ownership) and Hilli Episeyo (44.6% of the Common Unit entitlement). No contracted fee income was included for Hilli T3 or the oil derivative.

For equity accounted investments (the Partnership and Golar Power) we have included our proportionate share of their contract earnings backlog under the same assumptions that we have applied to our consolidated subsidiaries. In the future when our contract earnings backlog actualizes, we will show our share of their earnings net of interest and tax in one line in the Income Statement ""Equity in net earnings/(losses) of affiliates"". The Golar Power numbers are calculated based on an exchange rate of 3.7BRL:1USD.

Management has not forecasted net income for these aforementioned initiatives as information to provide such a forward-looking estimate is not available without unreasonable effort. Contract earnings backlog is not intended to represent EBITDA or future cashflows that will be generated from these projects nor is it intended to represent the dividend income that will be payable to Golar from our equity investments. This measure should be seen as a supplement to and not a substitute for our US GAAP measures of performance.

Gross Contract Earnings Backlog: Gross contract earnings backlog represents each Golar entity's share of contracted fee income for executed contracts less forecasted operating expenses for these contracts. In calculating the forecasted operating expenditure, management has applied the same methodology in preparing the ""Contract Earnings Backlog"" measure above. Management has not forecasted net income for these initiatives as information to provide such a forward-looking estimate is not available without unreasonable effort. Contract earnings backlog is not intended to represent EBITDA or future cash flows that will be generated from these projects nor is it intended to represent the dividend income that will be payable to Golar from our equity investments. This measure should be seen as a supplement to and not a substitute for our US GAAP measures of performance.

Distribution coverage: As defined in Golar LNG Partners LP most recent quarterly earnings release (Form 6-K), section ""Appendix A - Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Definitions"".

Revenue Backlog: Revenue Backlog is defined as the contracted daily charter rate for each vessel multiplied by the number of scheduled hire days for the remaining contract term. Revenue backlog is not intended to represent EBITDA or future cashflows that will be generated from these contracts. This measure should be seen as a supplement and not a substitute for our US GAAP measures of performance.

operation	"Payra Coal Power Plant Unit-1 Starts Commercial Operation

The commercial commissioning of the first unit of the country’s largest coal-fired Payra Power Plant project in Patuakhali has officially started at 5.30pm Thursday.

Due to pandemic situation, the station started operation without any publicity. With this, country’s power generation capacity reached to 19,630 megawatts (excluding captive power).

AM Khurshedul Alam, acting managing director of the Bangladesh-China Power Company Limited (BCPCL), the project implementing company, confirmed it.

The unit with 660 megawatts capacity came into the operation, when country is power saturated.

Moreover, increased power generation capacity has now become a burden for the power sector as electricity demand reportedly dropped by 30 percent.

Therefore, the plant is likely to become an economic burden for Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) as it will need to pay about Tk 160 crore in capacity charge every month apart from the energy purchase cost.

The Payra power plant project, launched in March 2016 following a Bangladesh-China joint venture.

Earlier, the BCPCL had a plan to go for the commissioning in the first week of February.

The test run of the first phase of the Payra 1,320MW Thermal Power Plant project, delayed by a year, finally started on January 13 this year.

However, the outbreak of the deadly coronavirus impeded the commercial commissioning of the country’s largest coal-fired power plant project in Patuakhali.

The plant’s two units are expected to generate 1,320MW power once the project is completed."	https://energybangla.com/payra-power-plant-unit-1-starts-commercial-operation/

Alexander Richter 26 Dec 2019

Discussions are ongoing with PLN and the government on the development for the second phase of the Muara Laboh geothermal power plant. With it it would expand the capacity from 85 MW to a total capacity of 150 MW.

We reported last week on the start of the 85 MW Muara Laboh geothermal power plant by PT Supreme Energy.

PT Supreme Energy Muara Laboh has now officially started the commercial operation of the Phase-1 Geothermal Power Plant (PLTP) Muara Laboh, located in Solok Selatan Regency, West Sumatra Province

PT Supreme Energy’s Founder & Chairman Supramu said that the operation of the Muara Laboh PLTP Phase-1 and Phase-2 development plan is a commitment from the company and partners towards geothermal development in Indonesia. This is also the company’s support for the Government of Indonesia in achieving its energy mix target by 2025.

“We greatly appreciate the strong and continuous support from the government, PLN, and the people of South Solok in particular, during exploration and development activities,” Supramu said.

Supreme Energy began a preliminary study in the Muara Laboh PLTP development project in 2008. Then, the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) was signed in 2012, and continued with exploration activities. The total investment for this phase-1 development reaches US $ 580 million.

Now Supreme Energy is in talks with PLN and the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) for the development of the Phase 2 Muara Laboh with a capacity of 65 MW. The development requires an investment of US $ 400 million and will start immediately after the PPA negotiations are completed.

In addition to Muara Laboh, Supreme Energy built the Rantau Dedap PLTP Project with a capacity of 90 MW in South Sumatra.

The project is scheduled for completion by the end of next year with an investment of around US $ 700 million.

The company is also preparing an exploration program for the Gunung Rajabasa Geothermal Work Area, located in the South Lampung Regency. Exploration activities will begin immediately after the negotiation of the extension of the PPA with PLN is completed.

Covid-19 delaying launch of 2nd unit

Some four months after it began a trial run, the first unit of the much-hyped 1,320MW Payra Thermal Power Plant has started commercial supply of electricity to the national grid. This is the biggest thermal power plant in the country.

It started on Thursday afternoon when the first unit of the coal-fired power plant added 660MW of electricity to the national electricity network, said officials concerned.

The power plant becomes the second of its kind in the country after the 525MW Barapukuria plant in Dinajpur.

Shah Abdul Moula, director of the Payra power plant, told reporters they went into commercial operation around 5:30pm on Thursday, soon after the test run of the plant ended.

""From now on, the plant is supplying 660MW power to the national grid,"" he said.

The first 660MW generation capacity unit started operating on a trial basis on January 13.

The second unit with the same generation capacity is likely to take more time to start operating due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Although, officials earlier told Dhaka Tribune in January that the plant was likely to start supplying to the national network this month.

Moula went on to say: ""Only around 1,500 workers, against 4,000, are currently working for the second unit of the plant…it is likely to fail to start operating even in June.""

Located in Dhankhali of Kalapara upazila in Patuakhali, the power plant started supplying electricity to the national grid over the 163km double-circuit high-voltage transmission line, connecting the newly built 400/230kV grid substation in Muksudpur upazila of Gopalganj to Patuakhali Sadar upazila.

The Bangladesh-China Power Company Limited (BCPCL), a special joint venture of Bangladesh's state-owned North-West Power Generation Company Limited (NWPGCL) and China's state-owned China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation (CMC), has been constructing the power plant involving about $2 billion as part of an understanding between Dhaka and Beijing.

On March 19, 2015, a deal was signed between NWPGCL and CMC to set up the Payra power plant.

Concerns about coal-fired power plants

Bangladesh may be hit by its own ""carbon bomb"" once its 30 coal-based power plants, including the aforementioned one, go fully operational by 2031, suggested a study launched on November 6, 2019.

The projects will put the country in a ""trade deficit"" because they will cost an estimated $2 billion or over Tk170 billion annually in coal imports, according to study estimates.

The report also warned that Bangladesh will release an additional 115 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) annually into the atmosphere, once all 30 power plants begin to operate simultaneously."	https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/2020/05/15/payra-power-plant-unit-1-starts-commercial-operation

operation	"Formosa 1 is an offshore wind farm developed near Miaoli, in the west coast of Taiwan. The 128MW wind farm is Taiwan’s first commercial-scale offshore wind project.

The farm was developed in two phases – a demonstration phase with two wind turbines and a commercial phase.

Two 4MW wind turbines were installed as part of the demonstration phase in November 2016 and commenced operations in April 2017. The second phase involved the addition of 30 additional turbines with a combined capacity of 120MW. The phase two construction works were completed in October 2019.

The green power generated by the Formosa 1 wind farm is sufficient to power 128,000 households in Taiwan.

Swancor Renewable, a subsidiary of chemical and composite material manufacturer Swancor Holding, is the project developer.

Formosa is one of the three projects approved by Taiwan Ministry of Economic Affairs Bureau of Energy as part of its target to build 1,000 wind turbines by 2030 to support the Taiwanese Government’s plans to produce 4GW of electricity through offshore wind. It also announced 36 sectors for offshore wind farm development in 2015.

Formosa 1 wind farm project ownership

Macquarie Capital and Orsted (formerly DONG Energy) entered an agreement with Swancor Renewable to purchase 25% and 35% interests in the project respectively.

In December 2018, JERA had signed a deal with Swancor and Macquarie Capital, for the acquisition of a combined 32.5% equity interest in the Formosa 1 offshore wind project. Swancor and Macquarie Capital will continue to be project shareholders.

Swancor Renewable holds the remaining 7.5% stake in the project.

Formosa 1 offshore wind farm details

Approximately 6km off the west coast of Miaoli in the Strait of Taiwan spread over an area of 11km², Formosa 1 wind farm lies in water depths between 15m and 30m.

“The green power generated by Formosa 1 offshore wind farm is sufficient to power 128,000 households in Taiwan.”

During the demonstration phase, the wind farm was equipped with two Siemens SWT-4.0-120 wind turbines, each with a rated capacity of 4MW. The turbines have a rotor diameter of 120m, 58.5m-long rotor blades and a swept area of 11,300m².

Wind turbines are installed on monopile foundations, using A2SEA’s Torben vessel. Siemens monitors the turbines from its remote diagnostic centre in Brande, Denmark, on a 24/7 basis.

The renewable energy generated by the wind farm will be directly transmitted to the proposed onshore transformer station.

Financing for the Taiwanese windfarm

The Changhua County Government signed a memorandum of understanding in March 2017 with Macquarie Formosa 1 and Swancor Renewable Energy to invest TW$210bn ($6.8bn) in the project.

In June 2018, Macquarie Group secured a project finance debt facility from a group of local and international banks for the project.

The final investment decision for the second phase of the Formosa 1 wind farm project was taken in April 2018 and the financial close for the same was achieved in June 2018.

A consortium of eleven international and local Taiwanese banks, along with EKF, Denmark’s Export Credit Agency, provided NT$18.7bn ($627m) in project financing over a period of 16 years. Clifford Chance is the advisor to the project’s sponsors.

Power purchase agreement for Formosa I

A 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA) was signed for the project based on the feed-in tariff (FIT) scheme with Taiwan Power Company for power off-take.

Contractors involved in Formosa 1 wind farm

Swancor Renewable engaged Sinotech Engineering Consultants for the construction of the offshore windfarm. Sinotech sub-contracted COWI for the turbine foundation design.

K2 Management acted as the general consultant and also conducted wind modelling and wind data analysis for the project.

Siemens was awarded a contract for supplying two 4MW turbines for the first phase of the Formosa windfarm. The company will also provide a ten-year service and maintenance programme for the turbines.

Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy supplied 20 additional units of 6MW SWT-6.0-154 wind turbines for the second phase of the Formosa 1 project.

IX provided technical and commercial advisory services on the wind turbines selection and tender. Appointed as the technical adviser for the project, Wind Minds provided advisory services on commercial issues, logistics and balance-of-plant works.

German company Palfinger Marine supplied two PF 8000 fixed-boom-type platform cranes for the project.

Tekmar Energy supplied its TEKLINK® cable protection system (CPS) to shield the underwater power cables during installation.

operation	"The first unit of 1320MW coal-fired thermal Payra power plant started commercial operation, taking the country's installed power capacity to 19,630 megawatts.

The 660MW unit of the power plant went into commercial operation on May 14 at 5.30pm, utilising the recently-commissioned 400kV Payra–Gopalganj power transmission line, an official told the Bangladesh Post.

Bangladesh-China Power Company Ltd (BCPCL), a joint venture of Bangladesh’s North-West Power Generation Company Ltd (NWPGCL) and China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation (CMC), are constructing the power plant with two units at Dhankhali, Kalapara in Patuakhali.

State Minister for Power, Energy and Mineral Resources Nasrul Hamid thanked the NWPGCL officials for successfully starting commercial operation of the country’s first mega power plant.

Earlier on January 13, the unit-1, first mega power plant in the country, started operating on trial.

Officials said the power from the Payra plant will be now transmitted to the southern region of the country by shutting down some costly liquid fuel-fired generation units in Khulna and other adjoining districts.

Construction of the plant started on Mar 30, 2016 with around 98 percent works nearly done.

The government has allocated 998.77 acres of land in Patuakhali district to the NWPGCL for implementing the project on a turnkey basis by using eco-friendly ultra-super critical technology.

The power plant is being built with financial support from China’s Exim Bank. The Framework Financial Agreement of USD 1.984 billion for the Power Plant between the CEXIM and BCPCL was signed on October 14, 2016.

The power plant would require around 12,000 tonnes of coal daily to generate electricity. BCPCL already has imported coal from Indonesia to run the power plant.

On the other hand, Bangladesh Power Generation Company has erected 400 kV power transmission line extending from Payra to Gopalganj, which has been successfully commissioned at the end of last month. The main objective of the line is to create necessary facilities to evacuate power from Payra 1320 MW Power Plant.

Bangladesh had not imported large quantities of coal earlier as its major requirement was being met by the country's lone-operational Barapukuria coal mine. The mine has an annual capacity to extract around 1.0 million tons of coal.

The Payra coal-fired power plant would be the first to be run on imported coal.

The second unit of the plant was likely to start operation in next June but it will be delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

“We’ve successfully commissioned the commercial operation of 660 MW-capacity first unit of the 1320 MW power plant at about 5 pm,” a top official at the North West Power Generation Company Ltd (NWPGCL) told UNB.

The Bangladesh-China Power Company Limited (BCPCL), a special joint venture company of Bangladesh’s state-owned NWPGCL and China’s state-owned China National Machinery Import & Export Corporation (CMC), has been constructing the power plant involving about $2 billion as part of the understanding between Dhaka and Beijing.

However, the first unit started test run in January this year and after about 5 months, it went into commercial operation, said the NWPGCL official.

Earlier, the 400 kV Payra–Gopalganj power transmission line was commissioned on December 31 aiming to evacuate electricity from the new power plant.

The first unit of the Payra power plant, which was conducting test run on completion of construction, was waiting for this new transmission line to start its operation.

Officials said this has been the very first power plant to be run through imported coal by large ships from Indonesia.

State Minister for Power, Energy and Mineral Resources Nasrul Hamid thanked the NWPGCL officials for their success for starting commercial commissioning of the country’s largest power plant being jointly built by China.

Bangladesh-China Power Company Limited (BCPCL) hopes the second unit of the plant will be able to start operation within next few months as transmission facilities are being prepared.

Officials said the power from the Payra plant will be now transmitted to the southern region of the country by shutting down some costly liquid fuel-fired generation units in Khulna and other adjoining districts."	https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/public/trade/payra-power-plant-starts-commercial-operation-of-its-first-unit-1589549413

operation	"Queiroz Galvão Energia will deliver 750 mw in wind power in five years

The company is completing the initial phase of its strategy for the sector and has an additional 400 MW for this year’s auctions.

13/Apr/2015 – By Lívia Neves, for the Brasil Energia website

Queiroz Galvão Energia will have completed the initial phase of its strategic plan for the wind power market by the end of 2016. In five years, the company – the arm of the Queiroz Galvão Group for investments in the electricity sector – will put 750 MW into service from the source. For this year, it has 400 MW ready to be negotiated either in auctions or in the free market.

A large part of the energy already negotiated by the company was actually sold in the free market. In this exclusive interview, the company’s CEO, Max Xavier Lins, talks about how to expand projects in this contracting environment. The executive also highlights an increase in equipment costs due to the exchange rate and the reduced number of manufacturers.

Last year, Queiroz Galvão Energia started operating three wind farm complexes in Ceará and is now ready to deliver three other wind farms in Rio Grande do Norte and Piauí. Will the company focus exclusively on the implementation of these plants or is it planning to negotiate new projects this year?

Operation in test mode started in Riachão (150 MW), Rio Grande do Norte, last March and will probably be completed by the end of April, with commercial operations starting in May. We have two other wind power complexes in Piauí, Caldeirão Grande I and II, totaling 400 MW. We expect to put the first one into service by the end of the year and the second one by December 2016. Our first three wind farms, Icaraí (65 MW), Taíba (60 MW) and Amontada (75 MW), on the coast of Ceará, were completed in 2014, in March, June and August.

With this, we will complete the initial phase of our planning which will give us a wind power capacity of 750 MW by December 2016. In other words, in five years we will add 750 MW, a huge challenge. Our portfolio is a mix of captive and free market [the Ceará plants were traded in the 2009 reserve energy auction and the other ones were contracted under the free market environment].

We have good projects in place now, with long-term wind speed measurements, certifications, and connection studies ready and waiting for commercial opportunities. We are quite focused on the implementation [of these plants], but we worked on those other developments at the same time, totaling 600 MW in the Northeast region.

What has been decided for this year’s auctions?

We have 400 MW ready for auctions and registered for this year’s tenders. They could also be traded in the free market, but this is part of a strategic decision.

How is the negotiation of projects in the free market going, particularly in terms of funding?

We see the free market very positively, as it can and should be a vector for expanding generation. We believe that this environment should be even more stimulated by the government. Obtaining funding is a challenge. Funding agencies prefer to back auction contracts. Nevertheless, they have been funding long-term contracts in the free environment, but they have more requirements, ask for more guaranties, longer periods of analysis.

It could help the expansion of the free market if funding agencies were faster to approve loans and could finance shorter-term contracts. Nowadays, they prefer to finance 20-year contracts, but this is unusual in the free market. Engineering economics should be developed to allow the funding of shorter-term, eight- to eleven-year contracts.

Wouldn’t this make energy in the free market more expensive?

It would if the engineering economics for amortization is the same. But there are creative engineering economics structures, for example with a portfolio where the investor agrees to replace contracts for new ones after eight years; having a guarantee fund... In short, creativity must be used.

We need to create formats that include the free market. And this can be a fast vector for expansion, especially now that the country is facing critical hydrology issues and many major expansion works are behind schedule either because they don’t have a transmission line or don’t have an environmental license. Adding wind power to the system takes much less time, we can build a wind farm in 14, 15 months.

We have been seeing increasingly higher price caps for wind power, this year the baseline has reached R$179 (in the alternative sources auction). What has been impacting project costs?

Several things. First of all, the machines, since many are linked to the dollar and the euro. So the exchange rate strongly influences equipment prices.

The second aspect is that we have a relatively small number of suppliers in Brazil. Few manufacturers conform to the rules of the main financing agent, Brazil's National Development Bank (BNDES). Where few manufacturers are available, competition is not so intense. The offer of suppliers that conform to the rules needs to increase if we want prices to go down due to the competition.

There is also the impact of inflation, which is now 8%. It affects the workforce, the services. It is a combination of factors that makes prices go up.

And to take part in auctions, you have to factor them all in. The fact that prices have gone up does not necessarily mean that the business has improved, the associated costs have also gone up, particularly equipment costs.

Where is there a margin to reduce costs?

This is every investor’s big effort. It must all be calculated since you start developing the area. New wind farms should b close to existing ones. This way you can share the same accesses, the same electrical connection, you can save the money you need for construction works. When you do this, you optimize maintenance costs, you don’t need to create many teams.

Conducting a single operation of the wind farms is also a solution. Here we created an integrated operations center, located in Fortaleza, from where we operate all our wind farms in the Northeast region as well as our hydroelectric power plants. This means optimization.

You should also look for the machines that are best suited to the characteristics of the site. There are many technologies that help you analyze and find the best machines and the best type of tower for the local winds. If you use machines that are not the best fit, you lose efficiency.

The wind farms of Ceará had high capacity factors last year and use Suzlon machines, which cannot be bought with funding from BNDES anymore. Queiroz Galvão Energia started using Alstom machines in its new projects. Is the capacity factor strongly influenced by the machines or is it more influenced by the project location?

Suzlon’s machines are available in the international market, but unfortunately do not conform to BNDES’s rules. It is a set of factors, and the machines are obviously a very important factor. Suzlon is a very good machine for that region’s wind, the results speak for themselves.

According to the National Electric System Operator, three wind farms in our Taíba complex and two in Icaraí were among the ten most productive in Brazil every month they were in operation. That is because they have a robust machine that is compatible with the region’s winds. And also because we have a preventive maintenance system that greatly increases machine availability.

But that doesn’t mean the same machine is the best for all types of wind. When we were building the Amontada complex, we verified that both Suzlon and Alstom machines met the characteristics of the local winds. And while Alstom met the rules, Suzlon unfortunately didn't anymore, so we chose the former. For each complex, we study all manufacturers to find the best type of machine and adequate tower height.

You mentioned that the number of manufacturers in Brazil is decreasing. Considering only the competition among these companies, is there a big difference between 2012 prices and today’s scenario?

At the start of 2012, we had approximately 11 makers that met the rules. After the change in BNDES’s rules, five of them remained at first. This number has been gradually increasing. I believe that over time more manufacturers will be included and this wider offer will eventually be good for the competition.

Free market projects seem to have more imported machines.

That’s right. Imagine that I am selling energy from a wind farm to a consumer in the free market environment and that this consumer is an exporter and is paid in dollars. We could have a contract in dollars. In that case, I could buy equipment from abroad in dollars and eliminate exchange rate risks.

Taipei, Oct. 12 (CNA) Formosa I, Taiwan's first offshore wind power plant, is scheduled to begin commercial operations by the end of this year, according to Swancor Holding Co., one of the shareholders of the wind farm project.

Robert Tsai (蔡朝陽), chairman of Swancor, a fine chemical and carbon fiber composite supplier in Taiwan, said the installation of 20 wind power turbines in the second phase of construction of Formosa I has been completed and the wind power mill's commercial operations will start by the end of this year.

The wind farm is located two to six kilometers off the west coast of Miaoli County in northern Taiwan.

Along with the first phase of construction, a total of 22 wind power turbines have been installed for the Formosa I project, paving the way for it to be the first offshore wind power farm to be inaugurated in the country.

Formosa I is jointly owned by Danish energy developer firm Orsted, which holds a 35 percent stake, Japan-based power producer JERA Co., which has a 32.5 percent stake, Macquarie Capital of Australia, which owns a 25 percent stake, and Swancor, which owns the remaining 7 percent, according to Formosa I's website.

Orsted is one of the companies that has received permission from Taiwan's government earlier this year to develop offshore wind power at a time when it is pushing for efforts to increase the use of renewable energy and build an eco-friendly environment.

Formosa I comprises two phases, with the first designed to have a total capacity of 8MW and consisting of two turbines that were successfully installed in October 2016.

The second phase will provide a further 120MW of capacity, which will boost the total capacity of the project to 128MW. That is expected to supply power to about 128,000 households each year.

Tsai said since Phase II of the construction started at the end of May, the project experienced severe weather, including strong winds and waves, due to the influence of four typhoons and tropical storms, but the unfavorable factors were overcome, allowing the construction to be completed.

After completing the 20 wind turbines, Tsai said, Formosa I will operate on a trial basis to generate power in preparation for the upcoming commercial operations.

The second phase of the construction involves several foreign wind power developers as subcontractors, including Belgium-based Jan De Nul N.V and Spain-based windfarm builder Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, as well as participation by wind power development specialists.

Tsai said the completion of Phase II in the Formosa I project represented a milestone for Swancor, which stepped into offshore wind power development in Taiwan in 2015.

It also represents progress for Taiwan's offshore wind power industry.

In September, Orsted said it was planning to issue Taiwan dollar-denominated green bonds on the local market by the end of the year to raise money for its renewable energy development here."	https://focustaiwan.tw/business/201910120005

Passengers were warmly welcomed by airport staff to celebrate the historical moment, with goodie bags and orchids. Subsequently, they received breakfast and coffee to kick-start their day. The same aircraft also had the honour of being the inaugural flight to depart Terminal 4, which took off at 6.50 am.

The self-automated system was also well received by the departing passengers. Terminal 4 uses facial recognition throughout the process, from the moment a traveller checks in, until aircraft boarding. Mainly, the aesthetics, heightened security measures, and seamlessness were praised. However, there were a few passengers who had trouble with the system and had to proceed to manual counters instead.

“After five years in the making, we are very happy to commence operations at T4.

“The new terminal will increase Changi Airport’s capacity by another 16 million passenger movements per annum (mppa), bringing the total to 82 mppa. T4 is expected to handle about eight million passenger movements in its first year of operation. More importantly, we are now able to deliver an even better travel experience to Changi’s passengers.”

-Tan Lye Teck, CAG’s Executive Vice President for Airport Management

Terminal 4, spanning a floor area of 225,000sq m, was built at a cost of S$985 million. One of the top travel hubs in Asia, with the inclusion of Terminal 4, Changi Airport will be able to accommodate 82 million passengers per year. In fact, Terminal 4 is a testing ground for technology to be used in Terminal 5 – slated to open in the late 2020s and is projected to bring up Changi Airport’s annual capacity to 132 million passengers per year."	https://www.sgbikemart.com.sg/blog/fully-automated-changi-airport-terminal-4-begins-operations/183/
operation	"Located approximately 15km from the city centre, Seletar Airport is a secondary civilian airport in Singapore. The airport is managed by Changi Airport Group (CAG) and regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS).

CAG announced plans to develop a new passenger terminal building at the airport in May 2016, to support the aviation growth in the region. The new terminal enhances the passenger handling capacity and the service offerings of the airport.

The new passenger terminal construction is a part of the larger Seletar Aerospace Park (SAP), an integrated aerospace park under development in the land adjacent to the airport.

Construction of the new terminal began in October 2016 and was completed in the second half of 2018. Operations at the passenger building commenced in November 2018.

Objectives and benefits of the new terminal construction

The growing demand for air travel and the increasing traffic at Changi Airport, the primary airport of Singapore, called for the optimisation of resources within the aviation system. Increasing Seletar Airport’s capacity by constructing a new terminal is considered one of the feasible solutions to meet demand and minimise the pressure on Changi Airport.

The expansion enables Seletar Airport to become a valuable complement to the Changi Airport, and will also strengthen aviation in the region. It will also create more opportunities to thrive in the Seletar Aerospace Park and reinforces Singapore’s position as a vibrant aviation hub.

The new terminal and recent airport upgrades are designed to meet specific needs of the passengers and provide a better travel experience.

Details of the new passenger terminal at Seletar Airport

The new passenger terminal is a two-storey building constructed towards the eastern side of the airport with a range of improved facilities and amenities. It replaced the old passenger terminal located at the western end of the airport.

Spanning 10,000m², the new passenger terminal features four check-in counters in the departure hall, baggage handling system, six immigration lanes, two security clearance facilities, and a meet-and-greet hall. It also features a gate hold room with a capacity of 200 passengers.

The Seletar Business Aviation Centre of the terminal includes a separate drop-off area and a dedicated check-in and lounge area for business aviation passengers. It also features meeting facilities on the second level.

The project also involved the construction of three aircraft parking stands and cargo shed at the eastern end of the Aerospace Park.

Turboprop aircraft operations at Changi airport were moved to Seletar Airport’s new terminal in December 2018. This move was made to free up space for jet aircraft operations at the former airport.

History of Seletar Airport

Constructed in 1928, Seletar Airport served as a military base until 1968, after which it was handed over to the previous Department of Civil Aviation (DCA).

“Construction of the new terminal began in October 2016 and completion is scheduled by the end of 2018.”

In later years, DCA was transformed into Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), which continued to manage the airport until it was handed over to Changi Airport Group, which was formed in July 2009.

Runways at Singapore’s secondary airport

The airport features a single runway (03/21), which was extended to the current 1,836m length from 1,592m, in 2011. The extended runway allows the airport to handle larger aircraft and heavier take-off loads.

The runway is equipped with an instrument landing system (ILS) that allows for operations even in low visibility and poor weather conditions.

Control tower

In January 2012, a new control tower, located on the east side of the runway, was opened at the airport. Replacing the old tower built before the Second World War, the new tower offers increased capacity, as well as improved air traffic services and aircraft manoeuvring guidelines within the airport.

Air traffic controllers have access to ergonomically designed workstations that enable them to handle multiple operations effectively. There are three workstations, which can be customised to suit specific role of the controller. The panels are arranged in an intuitive layout providing the controllers the most commonly used equipment at the closest.

Ground handling services at Seletar airport

A number of global aerospace companies offer maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) services at the airport. Some of them include Bombardier, Execujet, Pratt & Whitney and Rolls-Royce, which offer extensive facilities and hangars to provide maintenance and servicing for both narrow-body aircraft and business jets and components.

Ground transportation

Taxis and public buses are available outside the airport for arriving passengers. A taxi stand is located outside the arrival meeting hall, which offers 24/7 taxi service in Singapore.

Public bus services 103 and 102 are accessible from stops located opposite to the airport terminal building.

Details of Seletar Aerospace Park

Being constructed near the airport, Seletar Aerospace Park aims to transform the airport into a world-class facility to meet the increasing aerospace needs of the region.

Located on 320ha, the Aerospace Park will host a cluster of activities, including the maintenance, repair and overhaul of aircraft and components, design, manufacturing and assembly of aircraft engines, components and light aircraft, and educational, training and research facilities.

A number of international aerospace companies have already signed to launch their operations in the industrial park. By locating in such a closely knit aerospace business community, companies can reap the benefits of integrated environment, economies of scale and increased efficiency, new industry collaborations, and access to the park’s infrastructure and close proximity to suppliers, customers and partners.

Contractors involved

Takenaka Corporation was awarded a JPY3.8bn ($36.6m) contract by the Changi Airport Group for the construction of a new terminal at the airport."	https://www.airport-technology.com/projects/seletar-airport/
operation	"SINGAPORE - All operations at Seletar Airport have moved to a new $80 million passenger terminal, pulling the shutters down on the old facility that started handling civil flights 50 years ago.

The new terminal comprises one section for scheduled commercial flights and another for business aviation involving passengers travelling on chartered business flights and private jets.

The business aviation wing opened on Monday (Nov 19), said Changi Airport Group (CAG), which manages both Changi and Seletar airports.

From Dec 1, Seletar Airport will also handle all scheduled turboprop flights in Singapore, the airport operator said.

Turboprops, which come with propellers, fly at lower altitudes, and are able to land at smaller airports with short runways, unlike most jet planes.

Currently, only Malaysia's Firefly operates turboprops at Changi Airport. It offers 20 daily flights at Changi Airport - to and from Subang, Ipoh and Kuantan.

But with two weeks to go before the move to Seletar, the airline has yet to inform its customers of the planned move.

A spokesman for the airline told The Straits Times that no final decision has been made.

""We will move to Seletar Airport for sure. As to when that will happen, we are still in the midst of settling some issues internally and with CAG.

""We hope to be able to finalise everything by Wednesday. In the meantime, we will continue to sell tickets for our flights to Singapore. Our customers are the main priority and we will inform them of any changes.""

Firefly passengers, who now pay $47.30 in airport fees and levies at Changi, will pay $29 when the airline moves to Seletar.

The new Seletar development is to provide more space for Singapore's private and business jet traffic to grow, and free up capacity at Changi Airport for larger planes.

In a Facebook posting, Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan said that with the opening of the new terminal, all passengers, including those on chartered and private jets, will enjoy bigger, better facilities and easier transition from airside to landside.

""A lot of hard work has gone into ensuring that the new Seletar passenger terminal is in tip-top condition,"" he added.

CAG said Seletar Airport meets the relevant requirements of the International Civil Aviation Organisation on airport design and operations.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore has certified that the new facilities and infrastructure at Seletar Airport are ready for aircraft operations.

These include both scheduled and non-scheduled services.

To prepare for the opening, extensive trials involving more than 2,000 participants have been carried out since June 2018, the airport operator said.

These included the processing of departing and arriving passengers, systems for check-in, baggage handling, and immigration and security clearance.

Spanning 10,000 sq m, the new two-storey terminal is designed to handle up to 700,000 passengers a year.

In the departure area, there are four check-in counters, six immigration lanes, two security screening stations and a gatehold room - where passengers wait to board their flight - big enough for about 200 passengers.

The business aviation centre has a separate drop-off area, as well as a dedicated check-in and lounge area.

On the second floor, there are facilities where passengers can conduct meetings.

Mr See Seng Wan, general manager of Seletar Airport, said the new facility will provide better comfort to passengers and visitors ""in a pleasant terminal that is easy to use"".

He added: ""With the new facilities, we look forward to providing a new level of travel experience to our passengers at Seletar Airport.""

The construction of the new passenger terminal at Seletar is part of a renewal of the airport located within Seletar Aerospace Park, which houses more than 60 aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul firms.

Since 2008, Seletar Airport has seen several enhancements, including the lengthening of its runway, the construction of a new control tower and fire station, a doubling of the number of parking stands, additional taxiways and upgraded aircraft parking aprons."	https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/new-80m-passenger-terminal-opens-at-seletar-airport

operation	"SINGAPORE - Changi Airport's newest terminal - T4 - started its first day of operations early Tuesday (Oct 31) morning, marking a critical milestone in Singapore's aviation history.

Airport operations went off without a hitch, with passengers for the first flight out to Hong Kong streaming in as early as 4am to the departure hall to use the self-check-in facilities. Airport staff were on hand to guide them through the process.

The first arriving and departing flights at T4 were operated by Cathay Pacific - CX659 from Hong Kong arrived at 5.40am and CX650 departed Singapore for Hong Kong at 6.50am.

Nurse Minee Moh, 29, was at the airport around 5am to check in for her flight to Hong Kong for a five-day holiday.

""The check-in and baggage-drop experience was very good and very smooth. Other airports and T1 have the self-check-in system. It saves time, and I'm very honoured to be on the first flight out,"" she said.

Mr C.S. Tan, an IT professional in his 40s, and his family, who were heading to Hong Kong for a week-long holiday, were impressed by the airport facilities and self-check-in services.

""Everything is automated and very intuitive. We didn't know we were the first passengers, but it's nice,"" said Mr Tan.

Related Story T4 opening significant as Changi charts new flight path

His wife, Madam Angela Tan, also an IT professional in her 40s, said of the immigration clearance and security systems: ""It's definitely higher security, but it wasn't a hassle. The full-body scanning machines are quite cool, like you're in a Mission Impossible movie.""

Meanwhile, passengers arriving from Hong Kong on CX659 were greeted at the arrival gate by airport staff with orchids and goodie bags. At the baggage collection area, they were entertained by an instrumental quartet, and also treated to coffee and breakfast.

Passengers said the arrival hall was spacious, adding that the walk from the arrival gate to immigration was fuss-free, with clear signage.

Retiree Zhao Chuan Xin, 65, who is from Henan, China, said: “At other airport terminals, we have to walk around to find our way. But at T4, it’s a simple and direct walk from the airplane to arrivals. I’m very pleased.”

Cabin crew member Tan Yu Ling, 27, a Singaporean who was returning from a vacation in Hong Kong, said: “The new terminal feels very spacious. The automated immigration clearance system also looks very high-tech and futuristic.”

Passengers from Cathay Pacific CX659, the first flight to arrive at Terminal 4, greeted with orchids

Mr Mohamad Hossenbux, 51, a managing director of an aerospace company, also said: “The ergonomics, in terms of the lighting and decor, is very subtle and pleasing.” Added Mr Hossenbux, who is from Canada: “After a long trip, it feels relaxing and peaceful.""

Speaking to reporters soon after the first flight took off, managing director of airport operations management Jayson Goh said he was happy with the overall smooth operations and passengers' satisfaction with the new systems and amenities.

""(Besides the new automated system), engaging the passengers, creating new experiences and new options for them to have a memorable experience at Changi will remain a key area we focus on to strengthen the competitiveness of Changi Airport.""

When asked about some feedback from passengers who faced difficulties with the automated bag-drop system, Mr Goh said in Mandarin: ""For the new facilities, we will have staff to help teach the passengers how to use them. In the meantime, we will be sending more staff to each check-in counter; there are currently about six to eight staff at each counter.""

T4 is the newest terminal for Changi in nearly 10 years after Terminal 3 was opened in 2008.

The new terminal features new technologies, systems and procedures, such as a facial recognition system that will capture a passenger's photo at different stations, centralised security screening, as well as start-to-end self-service options for check-in.

To ensure that the high-tech systems were up to speed to handle passengers, a total of 150 trials involving 10,000 volunteers and airport staff to test different systems and processes were carried out before the terminal's opening.

Cathay Pacific and Korean Air are the first airlines to operate out of T4. The remaining airlines, including Cebu Pacific, Spring Airlines, the AirAsia group and Vietnam Airlines, will progressively move from other terminals over a week.

With T4, Changi Airport will be able to handle up to 16 million passengers a year, increasing its overall annual capacity to 82 million passengers.

This will provide the necessary capacity until the next major injection comes in about 10 to 12 years through the opening of Terminal 5.

In the first half of this year, Changi handled 5.7 per cent more passengers at 30.4 million, boosted by growth to and from South-east Asia, North-east Asia and South Asia.

The airport will add a third runway around 2020, while T5 - due to open some time in the late 2020s - will enable the airport to handle another 50 million passengers."	https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/changi-airports-terminal-4-opens-for-business-smooth-operations-for-first
operation	"For commuters in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Monday, July 17, 2017, started with a very comfortable first ride in the new Klang Valley Mass Rapid Transit (KVMRT) Line 1. The 51 km long rail line connects the Malaysian capital to outlying areas and is part of the governments vision to create a transportation backbone for the greater Kuala Lumpur and Klang Valley region. The MRT from Sungai Buloh to Kajang (SBK Line or Line 1) is the first of three planned metro lines. It runs 41.5 km on elevated and 9.5 km on underground tracks consisting 24 elevated and seven underground stations. With that new connection, the Malaysian government hopes to ease Kuala Lumpur‘s notorious traffic congestion.

Six Years Construction for MRT Line 1

The Mass Rapid Transit system, eventually comprising three lines, is Malaysia‘s biggest infrastructure project to date. The first line – connecting Kuala Lumpur to Sungai Buloh in the northeast and Kajang in the southwest – took six years to build and cost 21 billion ringgit (approx. 4.89 billion US dollars). “As Malaysians, we can stand tall today as we have a world-class project for the people. We are seeing not just the MRT but the shape of the future of Malaysia before our eyes”, said Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak at the opening ceremony.

The opening of Phase Two completes the entire 51 km long SBK Line and commuters are now able to reach easily the centre of Kuala Lumpur, such as the Golden Triangle and the old Chinatown quarter by using SBK Line. The second phase stretches from Semantan Station to Kajang Station which includes the 9.5 km underground and the 20.5 km southern elevated sections with 12 elevated and seven underground stations. Phase One was opened on December 16, 2016, and runs from the Sungai Buloh Station to the Semantan Station, comprising the 21 km northern elevated section of the line. Also the altogether seven interchange stations of the SBK Line started operation now and connect commuters easily to other transportation systems of Kuala Lumpur.

Huge Demand of public Transportation in Kuala Lumpur

Public transport in Malaysia has been woefully neglected as past administrations focused on nurturing a national auto industry and building roads and highways. Over time that led to world-class traffic jams, which the MRT system is intended to keep from worsening and hopefully reduce. The government has projected the population of the Klang Valley (the area served by the MRT system, which encompasses Kuala Lumpur, the federal administrative capital Putrajaya, and surrounding districts) will grow to 10 million by 2020 from 6 million in 2010. And the number of cars is expected to rise to 7 million if there is no marked shift to public transport.

According to a World Bank study in 2015, Malaysians living in the Klang Valley spent 250 million hours a year stuck in traffic. The MRT is part of Najib‘s ambitious plan to transform Kuala Lumpur into a metropolis on par with London, New York and Tokyo, cities with elaborate mass transit networks.

The second line, the Sungai Buloh–Serdang–Putrajaya line, is slated for completion in 2022, while the third line, known as the “Circle Line”, is still in the planning stage, though Najib said he hopes it will begin operating by 2027.

The MRT is designed to integrate with the existing three light rail lines, commuter trains, and KLIA Transit, the super-express train service linking central Kuala Lumpur with Kuala Lumpur International Airport about 60 km away. The MRT Line 1 is expected to carry an average of 150 000 passengers a day. The transport ministry expects that the first MRT line will cause the number of vehicles on the Malaysian capital‘s roads to drop by at least 160 000."	https://www.tunnel-online.info/en/artikel/tunnel_Kuala_Lumpur_MRT_Line_1_started_full_Operation_3020687.html
operation	"For commuters in Kuala Lumpur, the week started with a comfortable ride in the new Klang Valley Mass Rapid Transit (KVMRT) Line 1. The 51km long rail line in the Malaysian capital is part of the Government’s vision to create a transportation backbone for the greater Kuala Lumpur and Klang Valley region and ease the city’s notorious traffic congestion. Line 1 from Sungai Buloh to Kajang (SBK), with 41.5km on elevated and the central 9.5km aligned underground is the first of three planned Metro Lines. It took six years to build and at a cost of Ringgit 21 billion, about US$4.89 billion.

Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak leads the crowds into an opened underground station At the Line’s opening ceremony on Monday, 17 July 2017, Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak said: “As Malaysians, we can stand tall today as we have a world-class project for the people. We are seeing not just the MRT but the shape of the future of Malaysia before our eyes."" The opening of Phase Two on Monday opened the 20.5km southern elevated section and the 9.5km underground section with 12 elevated and seven underground stations. The elevated northern Phase One section from Sungai Buloh to Semantan Station opened in December 2016. Seven interchange stations connect the MRT to other transportation systems of the city (Fig 2).

Fig 1. Alignment of MRT Line 1, Line 2 and the Line 3 Circle Line New tunnelling technology used on the underground section of the Line was explained at the recent SEACETUS (Southeast Asian Conference and Exhibition in Tunnelling and Underground Space). Gus Klados, Tunnelling Manager for project contractor MMC-Gamuda described the development of the Variable Density TBM (VDM) in a joint venture with Herrenknecht. The last of the six VDMs used on Line 1 successfully broke through at Pasar Seni Station in April 2015. The VDMs proved remarkable in mitigating the risk of tunnelling through Kuala Lumpur limestone, which is known to be among the most challenging tunnelling conditions, featuring extreme karst formations. The same six VDMs are now being refurbished in Malaysia for further use together with four new ones in the new KVMRT Sungai Buloh-Serdang-Putrajaya Line 2. The world’s first VDM launched on 30 May 2013 at Cochrane Station and in fact completed the last breakthrough of the project in April 2015 after completing 4.4km through karstic limestone (Cochrane to beyond TRX Station), mixed face conditions and fault zones (TRX to Bukit Bintang Station) and lastly through Kenny Hill formation (Bukit Bintang to Pasar Seni station) operating successfully in its four interchangeable modes, after starting in the variable density slurry mode and finishing in full EPB mode.

Schematic of the VDM TBM technology The variable density convertible TBMs proved not only successful but also safe, tunnelling through karstic limestone with minimal incidents. The method provided safer, more predictable delivery, less disruption to the public, and underpins assurance that projects with the most complex geology can be completed as scheduled. VDM machines were also successfully used in Hong Kong and are specified by the client in the Perth Airport Link Project. “VDMs will be the best choice for difficult mixed face geology in the future,” concluded Klados. Demand of public transportation in Kuala Lumpur Public transport in Malaysia has been woefully neglected as past administrations focused on supporting a national auto industry and building roads and highways. Over time that led to world-class traffic jams, which the MRT system is intended to keep from worsening and hopefully reduce. Projections are that the population of the Klang Valley will grow from 6 million in 2010 to 10 million by 2020 with the number of cars expected to rise to 7 million if there is no marked shift to public transport."	https://www.tunneltalk.com/Kuala-Lumpur-MRT-20Jul2017-Full-length-of-KVMRT-Line-1-opens.php
operation	"A new passenger terminal at Oman’s A’Duqm Airport is due to commence operations today, the sultanate’s Ministry of Transport and Communications confirmed.

operation	"Earlier this month, Freeport LNG Development L.P.—the developer of Freeport LNG export terminal—announced the first shipment of liquefied natural gas (LNG) produced from the newly commissioned Train 1 of the three-train Freeport LNG facility. Freeport LNG became the fifth U.S. LNG export terminal in the Lower 48 states to be placed in service since 2016.

Freeport LNG liquefaction project is located on Quintana Island near Freeport, Texas ― about 70 miles south of Houston ― and consists of three liquefaction units with a combined capacity of 1.98 bcfd baseload and 2.14 bcfd peak. Construction of Trains 1 and 2 started in 2014, and construction of Train 3 in 2015. After a series of construction delays, Train 1 achieved its first LNG production on August 19. The second and third trains are expected to be placed in service in January and May of 2020. The fourth liquefaction train (capacity 0.7 Bcf/d) has been fully approved but has not yet reached a final investment decision.

The Freeport LNG liquefaction plant is located at the site of an existing regasification terminal and shares LNG storage tanks and other infrastructure with export and import facilities, which reduces the construction costs. The Freeport LNG regasification terminal can still receive and process LNG import cargoes; however, it has been mostly unused since 2010 because of the increase in domestic natural gas production. The last LNG cargo was imported to Freeport in September 2018 and was used to maintain the cryogenic integrity of the terminal’s storage tanks and to serve as a cool down cargo in preparation and testing of liquefaction equipment for LNG production.

Freeport LNG is the only liquefaction facility in the United States and one of only two LNG export facilities in the world that uses exclusively electric motors instead of natural gas turbines to drive the liquefaction compressors. The electric motors help the facility comply with the strict local emission standards around the Houston area. Freeport LNG requires 690 megawatts (MW) of electric power supply to operate three liquefaction trains, almost 9 times the Freeport area’s previous load, which was less than 80 MW. Several electric transmission upgrades (including Jones Creek transmission project) were implemented on the Electric Reliability Council of Texas electric power grid to connect transmission lines with Freeport LNG to accommodate the additional load requirements.

Currently, with Freeport Train 1 in operation, total U.S. LNG export nameplate capacity stands at 6.1 Bcf/d baseload (6.9 Bcf/d peak) across five LNG export terminals and 10 liquefaction trains. By 2021, EIA projects U.S. LNG export capacity to reach 9.5 Bcf/d baseload (10.8 Bcf/d peak) across six LNG export facilities and 25 liquefaction trains."	https://compressortech2.com/freeport-lng-begins-operations/

South Korean company Incheon International Airport Corp (IIAC) has announced the official opening of the new Terminal 4 (T4) at Kuwait International Airport.

The Government of Kuwait owns the airport, which welcomed approximately 12 million passengers in 2017.

Through a bidding process in April, IIAC was awarded the contract to operate the new Terminal 4, reported The Korea Herald.

Designed by the Spanish branch of the American company AECOM, the building was constructed by a joint venture (JV) Cengiz Insaat & First Kuwaiti Contractor.

The new terminal covers 55,000m² and is capable of managing 4.5 million annual passengers through its 14 gates.



It also features five bus gates and nine boarding bridges gates, with a capacity to accommodate eight aircraft simultaneously.

“The new terminal covers 55,000m² and is capable of managing 4.5 million annual passengers through its 14 gates.”

The terminal was built with an investment of $127.6m. It has been designed to alleviate the passengers’ traffic away from other terminals that have been operating beyond capacity for years.

In addition, the terminal building offers parking facility that can accommodate approximately 2,450 cars.

IIAC president Chung Il-young told the publication: “We will see to it that the terminal of Kuwait International Airport is operated without a hitch and will continue to expand our overseas operation to other regions of the Middle East, Eastern Europe, South East Asia, and Central Asia.”

Alongside creating around 2,000 jobs, the facility is estimated to generate up to $60m (KWD18.1m) in revenue per annum. It will also help strengthen Kuwait’s strategy to transform the country into a regional financial and tourism hub.

Terminal 2 is under construction and expected to become operational by 2020. The facility will involve an investment of $4.3bn with a capacity to handle 25 million travellers per annum."	https://www.airport-technology.com/news/terminal-kuwait-international-airport/

Sharelines

Muscat: “Duqm airport is a major upgrade in the aviation sector in the Sultanate,” according to Dr Ahmed Al Futaisi, Minister of Transport and Communications.



A grand official opening ceremony of the new Duqm airport was held yesterday. The event was held under the patronage of Sayyid Hamoud bin Faisal Al Busaidi, Minister of Interior.



Al Futaisi highlighted the importance of the new airport in aiding the growth and prosperity of the economic zone in Duqm.



“The airport is part of the special economic zone in Duqm so it will play a major role in stimulating the economic and tourism activities within the zone,” Al Futaisi said.

Regarding the characteristics of the new airport, Sheikh Ayman Al Hosni, Chief Executive Officer of Oman Airport Management Company (OAMC), told Times of Oman, “Duqm airport is equipped with state-of-the-art facilities supplied with all the services that a passenger requires, such as shops and cafes.”“The total built-up area is 9,500 square metres. As of now, the airport’s capacity is 500 million passengers a year, with an expanding capability of 2 million, if the demand exists. The number of passengers last reached 57,000 and the growth between 2017 to 2018 amounted to 49 per cent,” he said.Duqm airport is equipped to be an international airport. “The airport is currently linked to Muscat through flights. However, we have built this airport to be an international airport so that we can attract international flights if there is demand from certain countries or airports, and it can also serve private jets for private investors who want to come directly to Duqm,” Al Futaisi said.“With this new airport, the sea air cargos can move seemingly between the two places. This is a unique proposition for Duqm airport due to its proximity to the port,” Al Futaisi said.The airport officials are planning to increase the number of flights not only from Muscat to Duqm but to other destinations as well.“In 2018, the airport recorded almost 152 flights from abroad. The airport is equipped for international flights and the runway is capable of handling even the A380, which is currently the biggest aircraft,” added Al Hosni. Speaking about the future plans of the aviation sector, Al Hosni said, “The government has created a robust plan to expand the entire infrastructure, whether it is the airlines, the airport or other logistics facilities. We opened Salalah Airport in 2017; last year, we opened Muscat International Airport and on Monday, we celebrated the official opening of the Duqm airport. We are, therefore, looking forward to incorporating more facilities that will serve the aviation sector, as more investors come into the country. ”Mustafa Al Hinai, Chief Executive Officer of Oman Airport Group, spoke to Times of Oman regarding the Omanisation plans of the airport. “The staff we have at the new airport are fully Omani. We have also attracted talent from the local community and we are working hand-in-hand with the authority in Duqm to provide job opportunities.”Duqm Airport is the third among the Sultanate’s airports to be operated with all the facilities. The first operation of the passengers’ building began on September 17, 2018."	https://timesofoman.com/article/691082/oman/duqm-airport-to-bolster-civil-aviation-in-oman-al-futaisi

Cathay Pacific and Korean Air are the first two of nine airlines to be operating at Changi‟s brand new terminal. Korea Air‟s first arrival and departure flights at T4 will take place at 1955 hours and 2230 hours respectively.

Mr Tan Lye Teck, Changi Airport Group's Executive Vice President for Airport Management said, “After five years in the making, we are very happy to commence operations at T4. The new terminal will increase Changi Airport's capacity by another 16 million passenger movements per annum (mppa), bringing the total to 82 mppa. T4 is expected to handle about eight million passenger movements in its first year of operation. More importantly, we are now able to deliver an even better travel experience to Changi's passengers.

“We are thankful that everything has been smooth so far today. Our operations teams will continue to keep a close eye on the various systems to ensure that passengers enjoy a seamless travel experience at T4. We look forward to welcoming the other T4 airlines, which will start their operations progressively on 2 and 7 November[1].”

Plethora of delights to thrill passengers

The shops and restaurants at T4, comprising well-loved local and international brands, were ready to welcome passengers with their new retail concepts and offerings. Of the 81 outlets, 62 are retail and service outlets and 19 are F&B ones. About a quarter of them are making their debut at Changi Airport.

At the new integrated Cosmetics & Perfumes and Liquor & Tobacco stores operated by The Shilla Duty Free and DFS respectively, passengers were pleasantly surprised with the new convenience of being able to pay for all their purchases from the two stores in a single transaction. Others were attracted by the double volume retail outlets in the Departure Transit area, which wowed passengers with their attractive frontage, some spanning their entire 11-metre-high walls. Many passengers checked in early so that they could explore the various offerings in the terminal, including the different art displays and immersive LED walls.

One of the main attractions at T4 is the Heritage Zone, with its facades of old Singapore shop houses, as well as the row of F&B outlets exuding nostalgia through their local delights and old-school furnishings. They serve up well-loved traditional breakfast and snack items such as kaya toast, mee siam and kopi. Passengers were also excited to try the roti prata from the „live‟ prata station, where the popular Indian pancake is prepared by a chef right before their eyes.

“We have received very encouraging feedback from passengers that the offerings curated for T4 are refreshing and bring a new dimension to shopping and dining at Changi Airport. Our commercial team has paid attention to bringing in innovative concepts and new experiences for passengers spanning a range of categories, from the 'live' cooking stations for prata and BBQ pork, to the sampling of cocktail mixes and the test-flying of drones. We will continue to work with our tenant partners to create a fun, vibrant and positively surprising experience for passengers and visitors at T4,” said Ms Teo Chew Hoon, CAG's Group Senior Vice President for Airside Concessions.

operation	"The new Terminal 4 (T4) at Kuwait International Airport has reportedly opened officially following an announcement by its South Korean operator, Incheon International Airport Company (IIAC).

According to reports by Seoul-based news outlet The Korea Herald, IIAC was chosen as the operator for T4 through a bidding process in April, marking the first time that a foreign company was chosen to operate the Kuwaiti airport.

IIAC reportedly made the opening announcement on 11 December.

April this year saw Kuwait's Directorate General for Civil Aviation (DGCA) announce that IIAC would work on the new T4 facility after winning the project’s tender, which was placed in February this year.

Spanning an area of 55,000m2 and 2,450 parking spaces, T4 comprises 14 gates and can handle 4.5 million passengers each year.

IIAC has reportedly dispatched 30 officials with relevant expertise since May to prepare for the opening, adding the launch was possible despite the recent heavy rainfall in the country, which caused significant infrastructure damage and left at least one dead.

T4 was inaugurated by HH the Amir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah more than five months ago. It is expected to generate up to $60m (KWD18.1m) in revenue per year, providing approximately 2,000 jobs, and boosting the country's strategy to transform Kuwait into a regional hub for finance and tourism.

Expressing happiness over the launch of flight operations between the two places, Rawat said apart from Pithoragarh, it will also bring places like Almora, Champawat and Bageshwar of the state closer to New Delhi.

Travelling to New Delhi by road from these places used to take a lot of time. People can now benefit from flight services which are economical too apart from being time saving, Rawat said.

The flight service is also important strategically as Pithoragarh is a border district, he said.

A tulip garden is being developed in Pithoragarh which will attract a large number of tourists. Air connectivity will make it easier for tourists to visit Pithoragarh and neighbouring destinations worth visiting, he said.

Union minister VK Singh, Nainital MP and Pradesh BJP president Ajay Bhatt and Almora MP Ajay Tamta were also present at the ceremony.

A Heritage Aviation aircraft with nine passengers on board took off from Naini-Saini airport in Pithoragarh to mark the start of flight operations between the hill town and the Hindon airport in the NCR.

It is being seen as a major boost to air connectivity between the border district and New Delhi.

The Heritage Aviation aircraft, which took off at 11.30, was scheduled to land at Hindon airport at 12.30 pm, an aviation firm official said in Pithoragarh.

The one coming from Hindon will take off every day at 1 pm and arrive at Naini Saini airport at 2 pm, Heritage Aviation Manager M S Dhami said.

The fare from Pithoragarh to Hindon per passenger is Rs 2,470 while the return flight will cost Rs 2,270, he said.

operation	"After an eight-month-long wait, the first commercial flight from the Hindon civil airport started from today, 11th October. According to a PTI report, a private aircraft with nine passengers on board took off from Pithoragarh's Naini-Saini airport at 11.30 am. The one-hour flight will depart daily from Pithoragarh, Heritage Aviation Manager MS Dhami said. The one coming from Hindon will take off every day at 1 pm and arrive at Naini-Saini airport at 2 pm, Dhami said. The fare from Pithoragarh to Hindon per passenger is ₹2,470 while the return flight will cost ₹2,270, he said. It is being seen as a boost to air connectivity between the border district and the NCR.

The CEO of Heritage Aviation Private Ltd, Rohit Mathur told ANI that after the first flight to Pithoragarh the company plans to launch flights for other popular tourist destinations. The Hindon airport had been inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 8, since then there had been many assumptions about the first flight from it.

The starting of first commercial flight service from Hindon will greatly reduce the burden on the New Delhi airport and will also enable passengers from the western Uttar Pradesh region to save time.

Hindon Airport will reduce the burden on Delhi's IGI Airport

Reducing the load at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport, Hindon will serve as the ‘second’ airport. The air force station is located close to Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh.

Distance of Hindon Airport from Delhi IGI Airport

Hindon airport, which is around 40 kms from the IGI Airport in Delhi, belongs to the Indian Air Force (IAF) and the AAI has developed a civil enclave inside it. The Indian Air Force permitted use of the airbase for civilian flights under regional air connectivity scheme UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik). UDAN seeks to connect unserved and underserved airports as well as make flying more affordable.

Other destinations that Hindon Airport will cater to

According to CEO of Heritage Aviation Private Ltd, Rohit Mathur after this the company plans to start flights for Dehradun, Hubli, Shimla, Faizabad, Gulbarga, Nasik and Coonoor among other popular destinations.

MCIA Terminal is also envisioned to reflect the warmth, energy, and hospitality of the Philippines, especially Cebu, and provide a welcoming ambiance that is distinctly Filipino.

Its design representing a more contemporary way Cebu’s tropical resort economy and the rich tradition of craftsmanship, the MCIA Terminal 2 marks a milestone as one of the flagship projects under the Build, Build, Build program of the national government.

Hong Kong-based design firm Integrated Design Associates Ltd. (IDA) and airport planning consultant Ove Arup and Partners collaborated with local architect-of-record Albert Yu of Asya Design and three other Filipino design experts, interior designer Budji Layug, architect Royal Pineda, and Cebuano furniture designer Kenneth Cobonpue to design the tropical resort vibe of MCIA Terminal 2. On the other hand, GMR Megawide Cebu Airport Corporation (GMCAC) developed and will manage the airport for 25 years under the government’s build-operate-transfer (BOT) scheme.

The airport showcases beautiful curved wooden roof arcs with layered glass to allow natural sunlight to seep through the terminal. The sunlight then reflects on the floor tiles containing mother of pearls found in Cebu to create a gentle glimmer similar to sand, thus representing the ‘resort-feel’ look of the airport.

The airport also has:

48 check-in counters (expandable to 72)

12 escalators

15 elevators

7 passenger boarding bridges (expandable to 12)

550 car park slots (expandable to 750)

Sembcorp has commenced full commercial operations at the Sirajganj 414MW Unit 4 combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plant, located at Sirajganj, Bangladesh.

As per Sembcorp, the Sirajganj Unit 4 CCGT project, which is construction with an investment of $412m (£328m), is the country’s first public-private partnership power plant backed by foreign investment. The plant is powered by gas and is supported by high-speed diesel as backup fuel.

The power plant was developed by Sembcorp North-West Power Company, a joint venture between Sembcorp and Bangladesh’s state-owned North-West Power Generation Company. Sembcorp and North-West Power own 71% and 29% stake in the facility, respectively.

Electricity generated from the power plant will be supplied to Bangladesh Power Development Board under a 22-year power purchase agreement.

Sembcorp’s global gas & power business head Sriram Narayanan said: “The successful completion of Sirajganj Unit 4, Sembcorp’s first power plant in Bangladesh, is a significant milestone for the Group.

“I would like to congratulate our team on the ground, and also thank our partner, North-West Power Generation Company, the government of Bangladesh, our lenders and the local community, for their valuable support.

“Now that the plant has come onstream, it is set to provide an efficient, reliable supply of energy to meet Bangladesh’s growing power demand, supporting the country’s development for years to come.”

Last October, first phase operations in single-cycle mode began for the duel-fuel power plant.

Sembcorp secured financing for the project in December 2016

In December 2016, Sembcorp secured project financing for this project from International Finance Corporation (IFC), Singapore-based infrastructure project financing firm, Clifford Capital and CDC Group, the UK government’s development finance institution, have each contributed $103m (£81.5m) in the total project finance debt.

Earlier this month, the company also inaugurated the 225MW Sembcorp Myingyan Power Plant in Myanmar. Built at a cost of $310m (£245m), this is claimed to be the largest combined-cycle gas turbine plant in the country.

operation	"Summary:

Mactan-Cebu International Airport opened a new terminal in Jul-2018, nearly tripling the airport’s capacity.

Terminal 2 is being used for international traffic, which has more than doubled over the past four years.

Terminal 2 has the capacity to accommodate another doubling of international traffic, which is likely, given the rapid growth of inbound traffic and Mactan-Cebu’s position as a transit hub.

Mactan-Cebu’s domestic traffic has also been growing rapidly, driven by expansion from Philippine Airlines and AirAsia.

Cebu Pacific has maintained its position as market leader in Cebu, but Philippine Airlines and AirAsia have significantly narrowed the gap over the past four years.

The CAPA LCCs in North Asia Summit will be held in Cebu on 24/25-Jun-2019.

Mactan-Cebu traffic increases by more than 50% in just four years

Mactan-Cebu passenger traffic has increased by more than 50% over the past four years. The airport is on pace to handle 11 million passengers for the full year in 2018, compared to less than 7 million in 2014.

Passenger growth of 13% was recorded in the past three consecutive years – 2015, 2016 and 2017 – and was up another 9% in 1H2018.

Seat figure and capacity share figures are approximate. Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 0.8em;"">*Some Philippine Airline flights are operated by PAL Express Seat figure and capacity share figures are approximate.

Mactan-Cebu has particularly experienced rapid international growth, driven by a slew of new services from both local and foreign airlines. The airport is on pace to handle approximately 3.7 million international passengers in 2018, compared to only 1.7 million in 2014.

International passenger growth reached a staggering 29% in 2017, representing an acceleration compared to the 20% growth achieved in 2015 and 21% growth achieved in 2016. International passenger traffic growth slowed slightly in 1H2018, but was still up by an impressive 17%.

Mactan-Cebu international passenger traffic and year-over-year growth: 2010 to 1H2018

The airport’s domestic traffic has also increased rapidly in recent years, but not as rapidly as the international traffic. Cebu’s domestic traffic was up by 12% in 2015, by 11% in 2016, 8% in 2017 and 5% in 1H2018 – in all cases a few percentage points slower than the overall traffic growth.

The domestic market currently accounts for 64% of Cebu’s seat capacity and accounted for 67% of passenger traffic in 1H2018. The domestic market accounted for 75% of Cebu’s total passenger traffic in 2014 and 78% in 2010.

Mactan-Cebu domestic passenger traffic and year-over-year growth: 2010 to 1H2018

Cebu Pacific is the market leader, but PAL and AirAsia have been catching up

There are currently seven airlines operating domestic services at Mactan-Cebu and 23 airlines operating international services, including 17 foreign airlines (based on OAG schedule data for the week commencing 13-Aug-2018).

Cebu Pacific is the largest airline group by capacity at Cebu, accounting for around 31% of total seat capacity. The Philippine Airlines (PAL) Group accounts for 26%, and the AirAsia Group accounts for 21%.

The Cebu Pacific Group consists of Cebu Pacific and its turboprop subsidiary Cebgo; the PAL Group consists of Philippine Airlines and its full service subsidiary PAL Express. Philippines AirAsia (PAA) is currently the only AirAsia Group airline serving Cebu.

While Cebu Pacific has been able to maintain its status as Cebu’s largest airline, its market share has been declining in recent years due to more rapid expansion from the PAL Group and PAA.

Cebu Pacific’s domestic capacity share has declined from 68% to 44%

The PAL Group has nearly doubled its domestic seat capacity at Cebu over the past four years. The group currently accounts for approximately 32% of domestic seat capacity at Mactan-Cebu, compared to approximately 25% in Aug-2014.

AirAsia has more than quadrupled its domestic capacity at Cebu over the past four years, but on a much smaller base. AirAsia currently accounts for around 23% of domestic capacity at Cebu, compared to only 6% in Aug-2014.

The Cebu Pacific Group’s current share domestic seat capacity is approximately 44%, compared to 68% in Aug-2014. Cebu Pacific has slightly reduced its domestic capacity in Cebu over the past four years.

The small independent regional airlines AirSWIFT and Air Juan also operate from Mactan-Cebu but account for a less than 1% share of domestic seat capacity, according to CAPA and OAG data.

Mactan-Cebu domestic seat capacity by airline: 13-Aug-2018 to 19-Aug-2018

AirAsia and PAL focused on Cebu as their fleets expanded

Cebu Pacific took a hiatus from expanding its narrowbody jet fleet over the past few years. However, the airline is resuming narrowbody expansion, which will give it the capacity to resume domestic expansion over the next few years at Cebu and other markets.

PAA and PAL have continued to add aircraft over the past few years and have been focusing expansion at Cebu – and, to a lesser extent, other secondary airports – due to the slot constraints at Manila.

PAA and PAL have also pursued international capacity expansion at Cebu over the past few years, as has Cebu Pacific. However, the number of international seats added is relatively modest compared to the domestic expansion, and foreign airlines have accounted for a large share of the growth in Cebu’s international market.

PAL and PAA are the largest international airlines at Cebu

PAA is currently the largest international airline at Cebu by capacity, accounting for a 16% share of international seat capacity. However, this is temporary, and PAL will retake the top position later this year.

PAA currently has close to 16,000 weekly international seats at Cebu, compared to less than 8,000 at the beginning of this year. However, PAA is planning to reduce its international seat capacity at Cebu to 9,000 seats in Oct-2018 after Boracay Island reopens. Most of PAA’s international expansion at Cebu in 2018 has been driven by the transfer of North Asia routes from Kalibo during the six-month closure of Boracay.

The PAL Group currently has nearly 15,000 weekly international seats at Cebu, which will grow slightly later this year, whereas PAA’s capacity will decline. Cebu Pacific has 8,000 weekly international seats at Cebu, which will also grow slightly later this year.

In Nov-2018, the PAL Group’s share of international seat capacity will be approximately 21%, compared to 12% for both PAA and Cebu Pacific. Foreign airlines account for most of the remaining 45% of capacity as the other two Philippine airlines operating international flights from Cebu – Pan Pacific Airlines and Royal Air Charter – are very small.

Foreign airlines expand rapidly

Of the 17 foreign airlines currently serving Cebu, eight have launched services within the past three years – Emirates, EVA Air, Lucky Air, Okay Airways, Sichuan Airlines, T’way, Vanilla Air and Xiamen Airlines. Most of the nine airlines that were already serving the market have also added capacity – in particular China Eastern, Jeju Air and Jin Air.

Korea is the largest international market from Cebu and currently accounts for 60% of Cebu’s international seat capacity. Six Korean airlines serve the Cebu-Korea market, along with four Philippine carriers.

The Korean LCC Jeju Air is the largest foreign airline in the Cebu market and currently operates two daily flights from Seoul, as well as one daily flight from Busan. Jin Air and Korean Air are also among the top five foreign airlines in the Cebu market.

Of the 17 foreign airlines, 14 are from North Asia. In addition to the six Korean airlines, Cebu is served by five Chinese airlines, Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific, Japanese LCC Vanilla Air and Taiwan’s EVA Air. Cathay Pacific and China Eastern are among the top five foreign airlines serving Cebu.

North Asia dominates Cebu’s international market

North Asia overall accounts for 85% of Cebu’s international seat capacity, according to CAPA and OAG data. Southeast Asia has a 10% share, and the Middle East accounts for the remaining 5%.

There are currently 45,000 weekly one-way seats between Cebu and North Asia. Cebu-North Asia capacity has doubled over the past three years – from less than 23,000 weekly one-way seats in Aug-2015.

LCCs now account for close to half of Cebu-North Asia capacity and account for nearly 60% of total capacity at Mactan-Cebu. Fittingly, Cebu will host the next CAPA LCCs in North Asia Summit on 24/25-Jun-2019.

Qatar Airways to provide second link to Middle East

Middle East capacity is expected to grow by early 2019 as Qatar Airways has unveiled plans to resume services to Cebu. Qatar suspended services to Cebu in 2012, when the Cebu market was much smaller, and has included Cebu among a list of four new Southeast Asian destinations to be launched in its current financial year.

See related report: Southeast Asia-Middle East airline market: Qatar Airways grows rapidly, adds seven secondary cities

Qatar has not yet announced a launch date for Cebu but Mactan-Cebu Airport expects Qatar to launch Cebu-Doha service by the end of 2018. The airport is also reportedly working to secure new long haul routes to Europe from Finnair and Turkish. A new link with Australia is also a priority, with Brisbane being most likely the first Australian destination.

Mactan-Cebu also hopes PAL will resume service to Los Angeles, which it operated thrice weekly from Mar-2016 to Mar-2017 with A340s. PAL has been considering potentially using its new fleet of A350s to resume Cebu-Los Angeles; however, it is somewhat reluctant to use the new aircraft type from Cebu because the market consists primarily of leisure passengers, whereas the configuration of its A350s has a premium focus. PAL’s 777-300ERs are less premium-focused, but are too large for the Cebu-Los Angeles route.

China market grows rapidly

While Cebu will likely be able to attract some new long haul services, North Asia will continue to account for most of its international growth. In particular, China is a fast growing source market for tourism in Cebu and the Central Visayas region. Mactan-Cebu expects five more China routes will be launched by early 2019.

Mactan-Cebu already has 12 routes to mainland China but China has less than half the capacity of Korea, although Korea has only four routes. South Korea is the largest source market for the Philippines and the Central Visayas region, but China has been growing faster. Chinese visitor numbers to the Philippines increased by 43% in 2017 and another 44% in the first five months of 2018, while South Korean visitor numbers increased by 9% in 2017 and only 3% in the first five months of 2018.

Central Visayas is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the Philippines. Central Visayas visitor arrivals increased by 17% in 2017, outpacing the overall 11% increase for the Philippines.

Mactan-Cebu has the ability to attract transit traffic

Mactan-Cebu has clearly benefitted, and will continue to benefit, from rapid tourism growth in Central Visayas. The airport is also well positioned to benefit from tourism growth in other regions of the Philippines due to its wide domestic network, which now includes 25 destinations.

For passengers heading to secondary and tertiary destinations in the Philippines, Mactan-Cebu offers a much better transit experience than Manila. Philippine carriers are also keen to encourage international passengers to transit at Mactan-Cebu rather than congested Manila, where airlines are better off focusing on the local market, given the limited ability to add capacity.

The recent opening of Terminal 2 further widens the gap between Mactan-Cebu and Manila, providing an even better experience for connecting passengers. The new terminal is spacious and has a unique resort style design. Extensive retail and food options are available, providing connecting passengers a level of service that has not previously been offered at any Philippine airport.

Other Philippine airports have also been expanding their international networks and new international airports are preparing to open, including a new airport on Bohol Island (which is also located in Central Visayas). However, the other secondary international airports in the Philippines are much smaller, they do not have extensive domestic networks, and will attract a relatively small share of visitor arrivals with a focus on niche local markets.

Mactan-Cebu has the capacity to continue growing

Mactan-Cebu has successfully positioned itself as the second major gateway to the Philippines, adding two million annual international passengers over the past four years. Manila is still much larger and has seven times the international passenger traffic. However, Mactan-Cebu will gradually close the gap with Manila because it has invested in the capacity to support growth, whereas Manila remains constrained.

Terminal 2 has ample capacity to support further international growth for the next several years. Even if Mactan-Cebu’s international passenger traffic doubles again, the new terminal will still be operating slightly below capacity.

However, GMR-Megawide will need to continue investing in expansion to remain ahead of the growth curve. The original (now exclusively domestic) terminal is still operating above its design capacity, despite all international flights moving to Terminal 2.

The airport will need to expand its domestic terminal capacity and soon will also have to start planning a further international expansion if international traffic continues to grow rapidly."	https://centreforaviation.com/analysis/reports/mactan-cebu-airport-a-new-terminal-and-strong-international-growth-432701

The Inauguration on June 7 was just as exciting and energetic, with Sinulog Dancers and performers welcoming guests led by none other than President Rodrigo Duterte. MCIA is one of the flagship projects under the administration’s Build, Build, Build program and the first airport project inaugurated under President Rodrigo Duterte’s term.

Considered as the central gateway to the Visayas and Southern Philippines, MCIA is the second largest airport facility in the country. In 2017, it welcomed a total of 9.97 million passengers, a 12% increase from the previous year’s 8.89 million. This year, MCIA is targeting a 14% rise in passenger volume to 11.3 million.

MCIA currently has a total of 23 international destinations, 33 domestic destinations and 26 partner airline carriers. Ferrer says that in the coming months, they are looking to tap new markets in Australia, Europe, US, India and the Middle East. “Currently, there are no direct flights in these destinations. What we hope to do is to tap these markets through our existing partner carriers.” Ferrer also revealed that they are looking to increase flight frequency in the Middle East; East Asia, particularly China, Korea, Japan, Hong Kong and Taipei; and Southeast Asia, specifically Singapore, Thailand and Bangkok.

With a unique design that captures the warmth and friendliness of the local culture, Terminal 2 is set to transform MCIA into a world-class facility and resort-gateway. Designed by Hong Kong-based architectural firm Integrated Design Associates Ltd (IDA), the concept of the new terminal is inspired by the warm waters and the tropical terrain surrounding Cebu.

Spanning 65,500 square meters, Terminal 2 is dedicated to international flights and can accommodate 4.5 million passengers. The opening of T2 will increase MCIA’s current passenger capacity to a minimum of 12.5 million passengers per annum."	https://mactancebuairport.com/news/mactan-cebu-international-airport-terminal-2-starts-full-operations-on-july-1/

BEIJING: Even as Chinese president Hu Jintao was telling an audience in Beijing that the government will stick to the path of socialism on October 1, a quite capitalistic revolution was taking place in distant Sanxi province in north China.

The first-ever private railway project began construction on the 60th anniversary of the Communist revolution. It may seem like a modest beginning for the project���s private owners but the business focus is clear as the project will link coal mines of Sanxi.

Another project that will bring China���s rail network very close to the border of Myanmar went in into operation late September. This project connecting two towns in Yunnan province is now being extended to connect Ruili, the Chinese outpost on the Myanmar border.

The move has great strategic significance for India���s military brass closely watching the development of transport infrastructure in the border regions. The Indian army is already worried about another Chinese plan to extend the Tibet railway to Nepal making it easy for Beijing to move troops and ammunition close to the Indian border.

Song Xiude, chief of Kunming Railway Bureau, recently told reporters in Yunnan that the line will be linked to the South East Asian rail network via a 350-km-long railway being constructed between Dali and Ruili, a city on the Sino-Myanmar border. Construction of the Dali-Ruili railway began last year and is slated for completion in 2014, the official media said.

China���s first privately funded rail project will link the towns of Jiafeng and Nanchenpu over a stretch of 64.29 kilometers. The $340 million rail line will have six stops and pass through six counties in Sanxi province. It has been funded by two private companies-the Broad Union Investment Management Group Co., Ltd. And ufeng Railway Construction Investment Co., Ltd. ���besides the local state run Railway Bureau of Zhengzhou.

Shen Zhou, the project manager for the Dali project in Yunnan said construction of the like included 47 tunnels and 76 bridges.

""Geological problems such as landslides, quicksand, cave-in were persistent through the entire process of construction, and we have built a 5,800-meter-long tunnel in a stratum known as tuff, a type of rock composed of compacted volcanic ash, which is the world's first of the kind,"" Shen said."	https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/China-launches-first-ever-private-railways/articleshow/5087076.cms

The highway, with a total length of 650 km, connects Hebei's mountainous region with the capital and its neighboring provinces including Shanxi and Henan, benefiting a total of 7.4 million people living in the mountainous areas.

The highway will facilitate the poverty-stricken population in the Taihang mountain region as the local government is speeding up the development of red tourism, agricultural and sanatorium industries, said an official with Hebei's transport department.

The Taihang Mountain Highway has been built to be an important part of the integration of the transport network in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region."	http://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201812/28/WS5c25d56ba310d91214051855.html
operation	"It's the beginning of the end for the era of mega-dam building in China.

China Three Gorges Corp. last week turned on the first set of generators at the massive Wudongde hydropower plant, deep in the mountains of Yunnan province. About 170 kilometers (106 miles) downstream on the Jinsha River sits Baihetan, the last of its kind, scheduled to go into operation next year.

At full run, the two sites will produce more electricity than every power plant in the Philippines combined. They're the final two mega-dams in a Chinese construction boom that goes back more than half a century, one that became increasingly mired in controversy over the trade-off between the benefits of the renewable energy and flood prevention and the social and environmental costs.

Now, China's hydro industry is down-shifting toward smaller projects and pumped storage. Engineers have run out of the easiest locations to power massive sets of turbines and the falling cost of rival energy sources such as solar mean it isn't worth moving on to more challenging locations.

""It's so cheap developing renewables and coal-fired power, why bother injecting huge sums of money to develop hydro 2,000 kilometers deep in the Tibetan plateau,"" said Frank Yu, an analyst with Wood Mackenzie Ltd. ""The future of hydro is going to be pumped storage and is also going to be smaller and smaller.""

China's dam-building era began in the 1950s, soon after the Communist Party gained power, but it reached a crescendo in the past two decades. After Baihetan gears up to full capacity in late 2022, China will have completed five of the world's 10-biggest hydropower plants in just 10 years. China's dams generated more electricity in 2017 than the total supply of every other country in the world besides the U.S. and India.

Harnessing China's rivers, which flow from the snowy peaks in the west to the fertile deltas in the east, has always been a prime concern of its leaders. More than 4,000 years ago, the emperor known as Yu the Great gained eternal fame by employing dikes, dams and canals to control flooding that plagued the ancient civilization.

The Communist Party used a disastrous flood in 1931 to argue that the Kuomintang government was a failure, and when Mao Zedong took over in 1949 dam-building was a priority. But construction and engineering were often subpar, resulting in more disasters like the Banqiao and Shimantan dam collapses in 1975 that killed as many as 240,000 people.

As China emerged onto the global scene in the late 1990s, so too did its dam-building industry. ""Since the turn of the century, the country has more than quadrupled its installed capacity and accounted for over half of global hydropower growth,"" said Samuel Law, an analyst for the International Hydropower Association.

The modern mega-dam building period began in earnest with the long-touted project to block the Yangtze River at the base of the Three Gorges, a series of narrow passageways between mountains that hem in China's longest river.

The project was unusually controversial in China. Proponents touted the benefits of clean energy, improved navigation and the chance to tame one of the nation's most flood-prone rivers. Opponents focused on the million-plus people who would be forced to resettle from the narrow strips of fertile orange groves along the river's edge to harsher environments on higher ground, along with the loss of cultural and archaeological sites.

Work began in 1994 and when the final generator was switched on in 2012 it became the largest hydropower plant in the world, generating 22.5 gigawatts. Two more massive projects, the 6.4-gigawatt Xiangjiaba and the 13.9-gigawatt Xiluodu, were completed in 2014 on the Jinsha River, which feeds into the Yangtze. Along with Wudongde and Baihetan, the 1,200-kilometer stretch of water will have five of the 10 largest hydropower plants on earth.

Pickings are about to get slimmer. Big hydropower plants require large flows of water cascading down a steep change in altitude and China has tapped most of the best prospects that are easy to reach.

After Wudongde and Baihetan, there are no dams bigger than 10 gigawatts are under construction or in planning or permitting stages, according to Pavan Vyakaranam, senior power analyst at GlobalData.

""Although the country has a strong pipeline of mega hydropower projects, it has mostly exhausted its major potential sites and there is reduced scope for new announcements,"" he said.

A similar story happened in the U.S., where massive government dam projects helped pull the country out of the Great Depression in the late 1930s, including the Hoover Dam, the world's largest at the time. By the end of World War II, hydroelectricity supplied more than a third of the nation's needs.

Construction peaked in the 1960s, then slowly ground to a halt as utilities turned to nuclear power and opposition grew from farmers, environmentalists and Native Americans. Last year, hydroelectricity provided 6.6% of U.S. power supplies, according to the Energy Information Administration.

China hasn't completely run out of space for hydro. There are plenty of sites for smaller 1-to-3 gigawatt plants that would be signature projects in most other countries. So-called pumped-hydro projects can help store intermittent renewable energy for when it's most needed. And it does still have potential sites for mega-dams, they just aren't easy to get to.

The most prominent would be the Motuo dam on the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet, which at one point was being eyed as a potential 38-gigawatt plant, nearly double the size of Three Gorges. The Chinese government is still researching the site's feasibility, according to a person familiar with the studies, who asked not to be identified because the information isn't public.

But such a development is seen as unlikely by many analysts. Getting materials and workers to such a remote area would be enormously costly, as would stringing the power lines needed to get the electricity to market. And that doesn't factor in the geopolitical issues around damming a conduit that feeds some of India's major rivers, including the Brahmaputra.

As China's dam builders pack up their tools at home, they are expanding overseas. China's major development banks have financed nearly $44 billion worth of hydropower projects globally since 2000, according to researchers at Boston University's Global Development Policy Center.

""Chinese hydro companies are investing heavily in other countries in South Asia, South East Asia, Africa and Latin America,"" said GlobalData's Vyakaranam."	https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/china-mega-dams-giving-cheaper-renewable-energy-200706024235308.html
operation	"After a 72-hour trial operation, the first unit of the Wudongde Hydropower Station, China's fourth-largest and the world's seventh-largest hydropower project, was officially put into operation on Monday.

The station, located on the border of Sichuan and Yunnan provinces in southwest China, has a total installed capacity of 10.2 million kilowatts, with an average annual generating capacity of 38.91 billion kilowatts.

It's estimated that the amount of hydropower produced by Wudongde station will save 12.2 million tons of standard coal. The clean energy will be transmitted to China Southern Power Grid to help develop the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and other areas.

The station will also serve as an important part of the Yangtze River Basin flood control system, as its reserved flood storage capacity is 2.44 billion cubic meters, equivalent to more than 170 West Lakes.

World's thinnest arch dam

If overlooked, Wudongde Hydropower Station is like an eggshell stationed at the Jinsha River's V-shaped valley.

The double-curved arch dam has a maximum height of 270 meters, but its average thickness is only 40 meters, making it the world's thinnest 300-meter arch dam.

The eggshell shape is the best design considering the location, which can achieve the maximum balance between security and economic factors.

Thin as it is, the dam can block the river to form a reservoir that can store about 7.4 billion cubic meters of water.

A seamless dam built by low-heat cement

The dam also marks the world's first to be fully built by low-heat cement.

In the valley area where the dam is located, the sunlight is strong with big temperature differences between day and night and low humidity. Under such an environment, it's difficult to prevent crack if ordinary cement is used.

The low-heat cement is relatively stable and can reduce the dam's temperature stress significantly, which effectively solves a global problem in dam construction.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s massive Wudongde hydropower plant has begun generating power after a trial run, its owner announced, marking the launch of the latest in a series of costly and controversial giant dams on the upper reaches of the Yangtze river.

A ceremony was held on Monday to mark the coming on stream of the first unit of the Wudongde power plant, built near the provincial border of Yunnan and Sichuan on the Jinsha river, the upstream branch of the Yangtze.

Wudongde began construction at the end of 2015 and will be fully completed by the second half of next year, according to the Three Gorges Project Corporation, the state-owned firm in charge of the project.

The project has a designed capacity of more than 10 gigawatts and its 270-metre high dam is one of the tallest in the world, dwarfing the one at the Three Gorges project around 950 kilometres (590 miles) to the east, which stands at 181 metres. Around 32,000 residents have been displaced to make way for a 7.4 billion cubic metre reservoir.

State news agency Xinhua said total investment in the project stands at 120 billion yuan ($16.95 billion).

The project is part of a “cascade” of six giant hydropower plants built on the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze by the Three Gorges Project Corporation.

Environmentalists say the projects have caused irreparable damage to the region’s already fragile environment, but the government insists any negative aspects are outweighed by the benefits of clean power, easier navigation and more effective flood control.

It will form part of China’s West-East Power Transmission Project aimed at delivering electricity to the high energy-consuming market along the eastern coast via ultra-high voltage grids, though critics say there is not enough cross-country grid capacity or power demand to justify such projects.

Although, the first of the three units was officially inaugurated by the country’s Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbas in March 2018, it could not start electricity generation due to non-availability of water in River Indus at Tarbela in current year.

The unit, which is currently under reliability period, has been providing 335MW of electricity to the national grid.

WAPDA said that the second unit of Tarbela 4th Extension Hydropower Project has recently entered wet commissioning phase and is now scheduled to enter its reliability period in first week of July.

The fourth expansion of the Tarbela hydropower plant will increase the output of this plant to a total of 4,888MW. This represents a capacity increase of around 40%.

WAPDA said in a statement: “Tarbela 4th Extension is a component of least-cost energy generation plan being implemented by WAPDA on priority to meet electricity requirements in the country and increase the ratio of hydel electricity in the National Grid to stabilize electricity tariff for the consumers.”

The Tarbela 4th Extension Hydropower Project will have capacity to provide 3.84 billion units of electricity to the National Grid annually.

Voith, as a key partner for the Tarbela 4th Extension project, is responsible for the supply, installation and commissioning the entire electromechanical equipment.

The expansion of the hydropower plant is a part of the country’s effort to reduce dependency on fuel imports and cover its growing need for energy.

Although, Pakistan has an estimated hydropower potential of around 40,000MW, it is using only around 7,300MW, Voith said earlier this year.

By 2025, Pakistan aims to have 20,000MW of additional hydro-power and increase the hydropower share in the national energy mix from 34% to 70%."	https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/news/first-unit-of-1410mw-tarbela-iv-hydropower-plant-begins-operations/

operation	"A new solar power complex in Tay Ninh Province started operations on September 7, 2019, considered the largest of its kind in Southeast Asia. Photo by VnExpress/Quynh Tran.

The inauguration of the Dau Tieng Solar Power Complex, a joint venture between Vietnamese construction firm Xuan Cau and Thai conglomerate B.Grimm, took place Saturday in Tan Chau District, Tay Ninh Province, around 100 km (62 miles) from Ho Chi Minh City.

The $391 million complex covers 540 hectares within the semi-submerged land at Dau Tieng Lake, the largest manmade lake in the country.

Construction on the complex started in June last year and was completed in about 10 months.

The plant is expected to provide about 688 million kWh of electricity annually, equivalent to the consumption of nearly 320,000 households. It is estimated that electricity generated by the farm can meet the power demand of Tay Ninh and supply additional power to the southern region.

Nguyen Van Binh, head of the Central Economic Commission, said at the inauguration ceremony that the plant would help turn Tay Ninh into one of the country's ""capitals"" of solar power.

""It will contribute to the valuable resources of green and clean energy, while helping ensure national energy security and boosting local socio-economic development,"" he said.

Tay Ninh is reportedly a province with great potential for renewable energy. It already has 10 solar power projects, six of them in the semi-flooded area of Dau Tieng Lake.

The 10 projects are estimated to generate a total capacity of 808 MW. Nine of them have begun operations, producing 668 MW of electiricty.

Vietnam has great potential for renewable energy with 2,700 hours of sunshine a year, according to the Institute of Strategy and Policy on Natural Resources and Environment. The government has issued several policies to attract investment into renewable energy towards reducing the country's dependence on thermal power.

Solar power currently accounts for 0.01 percent of the country's total power output, but the government plans to increase the ratio to 3.3 percent by 2030 and 20 percent by 2050.

Vietnam now depends largely on hydropower and thermal power plants for its electricity demands, but the projects have often drawn criticism from both local and international communities for their adverse environmental impacts.

The country aims to produce 10.7 percent of its electricity through renewable energy by 2030, mainly through solar and wind energy."	https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/southeast-asia-s-largest-solar-farm-begins-operations-in-southern-vietnam-3979068.html

operation	"LAHORE: Following improved hydrological conditions and availability of water, the first unit of Tarbela 4th Extension Hydropower Project has started electricity generation.

The unit, which is passing through its reliability run test these days, has been providing 335MW of electricity to the national grid, which will be gradually increased to its maximum capacity of 470MW.

“Though first unit was completed in April, it could not start electricity generation owing to non-availability of water caused by low inflows in River Indus at Tarbela in current year,” said a spokesman for the Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda).

The second unit of Tarbela 4th Extension Hydropower Project has also been put into wet commissioning three days ago. This unit is scheduled to enter its reliability run test phase in next month’s first week, he added.

The 1,410MW Tarbela 4th Extension Project having three electric power generating units — each of them 470MW capacity — has been built at the Tunnel 4 of Tarbela Dam. The project is a component of least-cost energy generation plan being implemented by Wapda on priority to meet electricity requirements in the country and increase the ratio of hydro electricity in the National Grid to stabilise electricity tariff for the consumers.

With completion of the project, generation capacity of the existing Tarbela Hydel Power Station will increase to 4,888MW from the existing 3,478MW. The project will provide 3.84 billion units of electricity to the national grid per annum. “Annual benefits of the project have been estimated at Rs30bn. It will pay back its cost in just three years,” the spokesman said.

operation	"On October 5, TTC Group and Gia Lai Electricity JSC (GEC)—a member of TTC Group—held the inauguration ceremony of TTC Phong Dien Solar Power Plant in My Hoa hamlet, Dien Loc commune, Phong Dien District, Thua Thien Hue province.

Invested by Gia Lai Electricity JSC, TTC Phong Dien Solar Power Plant is located about 50 km to the north of Hue City and about 16 km to the east of Phong Dien Town centre. The 45-hectare plant has a capacity of 35MW and total investment capital of nearly $42.9 million.

The project began its construction in January 2018 with some 300 domestic and foreign workers and engineers. 145,560 solar panels have been installed with advanced technology and equipment, bringing high efficiency. These panels will absorb the sun’s radiation and convert it into electricity to then feed it to the power transmission system.

TTC Phong Dien Solar Power Plant can now generate electricity with a capacity of about 60 million kWh per year, equivalent to the annual electricity consumption of about 32,628 households in Vietnam. It is estimated to reduce CO2 emissions by approximately 20,503 tonnes per year. In 2019, the capacity is expected to expand to 29.5MW on a 38.5-hectare plant of solar panels.

Speaking at the event, representatives of TTC Group said: “The implementation and operation of the TTC Phong Dien Solar Power Plant are important for TTC Group and GEC.

The TTC Group and its member company, the Gia Lai Electricity JSC (GEC), inaugurated the TTC Phong Dien Solar Power Plant in Phong Dien district in central Thua Thien Hue province on October 5; the first 35 MW solar power plant to be put into operation in Vietnam.

Invested by GEC, TTC Phong Dien is located about 50 km to the north of the provincial capital of Hue. The 45-ha plant has a capacity of 35 MW and total investment capital of around $23.4 million. Construction began last January with a total workforce of more than 300 domestic and foreign workers and engineers.

Some 145,560 solar panels were installed with advanced technology and equipment that will absorb the sun’s radiation and convert it into electricity for the national power transmission system.

After nine months of construction and equipment installation, TTC Phong Dien will generate about 60 million kWh of electricity per year. This is roughly equal to the annual electricity consumption of 32,628 households in Vietnam and it’s estimated to reduce CO2 emissions by approximately 20,503 tons per year.

The plant ensures synchronous development between power sources and electricity grids while maintaining the safe and economic operation of the power system and, especially, investment efficiency. Besides adding to the curbing of global warming and protecting the environment, the plant also creates jobs and bolsters local socioeconomic development.

“The implementation and operation of the TTC Phong Dien Solar Power Plant are very important to the TTC Group and GEC,” Mr. Dang Van Thanh, Chairman of the TTC Group, told the opening ceremony. “Although we are relatively new to this sector, the positive policies of the government and the efforts of the business prove that Vietnam has the fundamentals to develop clean energy sources that are friendly on the environment. It also contributes to national energy supply, ensuring national energy security, and meets electricity demand.”

“It’s very encouraging to see the TTC Phong Dien Solar Power Plant go online, paving the way for the development of Vietnam’s solar energy sector by leveraging the private sector,” said Mr. Kyle Kelhofer, IFC Country Manager for Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos. “As a development institution and a GEC shareholder, IFC believes GEC is moving on the right track to tap into the rich potential of Vietnam’s green energy sector, improving national energy supply capacity through expanding the supply of reliable and clean energy.”

The inauguration of the Dau Tieng Solar Power Complex, a joint venture between Vietnamese construction firm Xuan Cau and Thai conglomerate B.Grimm, took place Saturday in Tan Chau District, Tay Ninh Province, around 100 km (62 miles) from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam News Express reported.

The $391 million complex covers 540 hectares within the semi-submerged land at Dau Tieng Lake, the largest manmade lake in the country.

Construction on the complex started in June last year and was completed in about 10 months.

It is expected to provide Vietnam’s national electricity grid with about 688 million kWh per year, equivalent to the consumption of nearly 320,000 households. The developers believe the solar power plant can meet electricity demand for all of Tay Ninh, while also supplying some power for other parts of southern Vietnam.

A new solar power complex in Tay Ninh Province started operations on September 7, 2019, considered the largest of its kind in Southeast Asia. Image: VnExpress/Quynh Tran.

Nguyen Van Binh, head of the Central Economic Commission, said at the inauguration ceremony that the plant would help turn Tay Ninh into one of the country's ""capitals"" of solar power.

""It will contribute to the valuable resources of green and clean energy, while helping ensure national energy security and boosting local socio-economic development,"" he said.

According to a report by Solarplaza, in 2018, Vietnam achieved almost 99% electrification; however, energy demand is expected to grow by 10% annually over the next five years, meaning overall capacity will need to double. The development of renewable energy sources is therefore necessary to ensure energy security and meet the growing power demand.

Solar power currently accounts for 0.01 percent of the country's total power output, but the government plans to increase the ratio to 3.3 percent by 2030 and 20 percent by 2050.

operation	"The Hanoi-Haiphong Expressway is the first and the most modern expressway in the northern Vietnam, the easternmost country in South East Asia. The 105.5km-long, six-lane highway begins at the Belt Road 3 in Ha Noi, the capital city of Vietnam, runs through Hung Yen, Hai Duong, the two major provinces in northern Vietnam, and ends at Dinh Vu port in Hai Phong.

It connects the existing highways at six points, enhancing access to Dinh Vu port, the biggest sea port in the country. It enhances the connectivity of northern economic region, as well as increases its efficiency by boosting the socioeconomic development of the region.

The project is managed by the China Road and Bridge Corporation. Vietnam Infrastructure Development and Finance Investment Joint Stock Company (VIDIFI), a joint venture (JV) between Vinaconex, Vietnam Development Bank, Bank for Foreign Trade of Vietnam and the Saigon Investment Joint Stock company, owns and operates the expressway.

Hanoi-Haiphong expressway project details

Comprising a 22.7km-long stretch, the first section of the project was opened in May 2015. The section runs from the intersection with National Highway 10 to another intersection in Duong Kinh district.

Another 52km expressway section was opened in September 2015, bringing the total operating length of the expressway to 75km.

“Vietnam Development Bank is funding the entire cost of the project, which is estimated to be approximately VND45.5tn ($2bn).”

The motorway is 33m-wide and has a total of 54 bridges. It features green belt and fencing wall on both sides, while a 10m-wide roadside is used for technical corridor serving pipelines, fibre cables and noise immunity.

It is the first and only expressway in Vietnam, which is not surrounded by domestic buildings as both sides are landscaped with parks, green belt and technical works for its operation.

The motorway is designed for vehicles travelling up to a speed of 120km/h, while those designed for lesser speeds (less than 60km/h) are not allowed.

Project background

Located centrally in the northern region of the country, Hanoi, Hai Phong and Quang Ninh have become a strong economic triangle, determining the social and economic development of the area.

The new industrial zones along the region, especially along the Highway 5, have been the driving force for the development. The highway is the main axis road connecting Hanoi to Haiphong and is responsible to carry a big volume of goods and passengers.

A strong transport network was found necessary in order to leverage the opportunities in the area. To facilitate the same, Highway 5 has been upgraded from a dual-lane highway to four-to six-lane highway, according to the Road level 1 standard. However, it has been overloaded from the past few years due to the development of industrial zones and living groups along the highway.

The Hanoi-Haiphong motorway project was then included in the development strategy of Vietnam’s communications and transport. The expressway network was designed to pass through the main economic regions in Northern Vietnam to expedite and support the development of the localities in the area and the neighbouring provinces.

The Vietnamese Government approved the pre-feasibility study report, including the route plan and investment scale, of the motorway in build-operate-transfer (BOT) form.

The building investment for the project was set up in 2004 and in 2007, the minister of communications and transportation announced Vietnam Development Bank as the investor for the project.

Contractors involved with the Hanoi-Haiphong expressway

The construction contract for the project was awarded to SK C&C, the system integration subsidiary of SK Group. The company imported Korea’s cutting-edge traffic system for the project.

It also installed a robust monitoring system, which collects data from tollhouse systems, vehicle detecting machines, traffic scoreboards and closed-circuit TVs, and sends it to the central management office of the expressway, enabling real-time monitoring of traffic volume on the expressway.

Meinhardt International in association with Japan Engineering Consultants provided the construction supervision services. Hadicon was engaged in conducting survey and design works for three packages of the expressway for a total length of approximately 30km. Joton was the supplier of traffic paints for the project.

Financing

A 48MW PV project in Vietnam, serving as a joint construction project between Sharp Energy Solutions Corporation, the Thanh Thanh Cong Group (TTC) and the Gia Lai Electricity Joint Stock Company, began commercial operation in the final week of September.

A completion ceremony was held at the site on 5 October, with officials from Vietnam’s Industry and Trade Ministry, Home Affairs Ministry and more.

The PV project in central Thua Thien-Hue Province has an energy output that is equivalent to the amount consumed in a year by 32,628 average Vietnamese households.

Construction began last January with a total workforce of more than 300 domestic and foreign workers and engineers. Around 145,560 modules were installed. The plant will supply power to the equivalent of 32,628 households per year. By 2019, the plant capacity will expand by an additional 29.5MW over 38.5 hectares of land.

The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge has got off to a good start, serving about 1.79 million passengers in the first month of smooth and orderly operation, the Ministry of Transport said on Thursday.

As of midnight on Tuesday, the bridge's daily passenger volume reached 64,000, with the highest hitting 103,000 on Nov 18.

""The figures exceed our expectations,"" said Yiu Si-wing, who represents the tourism sector in the legislature of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. He added that the bridge's first month of operation had a positive impact on the city's tourism industry.

Yet, he admitted that the immediate benefits are not as significant as he had thought they would be.

He mentioned that perhaps 20 percent of the passengers who used the boundary-crossing bridge were there just to ""worship the bridge"". They had no intention of entering Hong Kong.

Moreover, Yiu said, for those who did enter Hong Kong via the bridge, the majority were on one-day tours, bypassing hotels and tourist spots or resorts.

Passenger vehicles represented up to 97.6 percent of the total traffic on the bridge, according to the ministry. Shuttle buses accounted for 45 percent of the total vehicle traffic, with private cars making up another 30.5 percent. Cargo accounted for 2.4 percent.

Rush hours were from 10 am to noon and 5 pm to 7 pm, the data showed.

""We saw no traffic congestion on the bridge at all,"" said Teddy Chung Wai-tong, vice-chairman of the Hong Kong Macau Cross Border Association. But he said that passenger congestion did occur on weekends as people gathered to wait for shuttle buses.

Shuttles on the bridge carry passengers to the three border checkpoints in Hong Kong; Macao; and Zhuhai, Guangdong province, while crossborder coaches can send passengers to downtown areas in the three places.

Chung hoped the Hong Kong government would increase quotas for the crossborder coaches to ease the burden of the shuttle buses.

He cited his own company, One Bus Hong Kong Macau, as an example. The company provides cross-border coach service between Hong Kong and Macao.

""We can only serve a maximum of 5,000 passengers a day because of the quota restrictions. But the daily volume of passengers traveling between Hong Kong and Macao may climb to 30,000 on weekends,"" he said.

But to Yiu, the quota increase doesn't seem urgent.

""Since the bridge has only been open to traffic for a month, it would be better to consider and review the quota policies after further observations have been made over a longer period.""

The bridge officially opened on Oct 23. Its 55-kilometer-long complex of bridge structures, tunnels and island crossings connect the east and west sides of the Pearl River Delta in South China."	https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201811/23/WS5bf74242a310eff30328a854.html

Passengers take photos of the Shanghai-Suzhou-Nantong Yangtze River Bridge on a train from Shanghai to Nantong as both the bridge and the Shanghai-Suzhou-Nantong Railway opened on Wednesday. (YIN LIQIN/CHINA NEWS SERVICE) Span expected to help ease traffic for travelers from Nantong to Shanghai July 3,2020 -- A grand bridge over the Yangtze River serving cars and trains began operations on Wednesday in Nantong, Jiangsu province, and is expected to greatly promote the integration of the Yangtze River Delta and bolster the economy of one of China's most developed regions, the country's top transport authorities said. The Shanghai-Suzhou-Nantong Yangtze River Bridge stretches 11,072 meters, with a single span of 1,092 meters. It took six years and four months to build between Nantong and Zhangjiagang, a county-level city of Suzhou city, Jiangsu province. Wang Feng, deputy chief engineer of China Railway Corporation, said that many new technologies were used in the cable-stayed bridge, including an advanced anti-collision system and cables with the highest tensile strength in the world. ""The anti-collision system can warn the river traffic authority within 3 kilometers if a ship appears likely to strike a bridge pier,"" he said. Each of the bridge's 432 cables can hold up to 1,000 metric tons, roughly the weight of more than 600 cars. A total of 480,000 tons of steel were used for the bridge. As the second dual-use bridge in Jiangsu, following the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, the newly opened structure will greatly ease traffic congestion that currently occurs on two neighboring Yangtze River bridges in Nantong and Wuxi cities. Travel time between Nantong and Wuxi by highway will be cut in half to 40 minutes. The upper half of the bridge, a highway of six lanes, has a speed limit of 100 kilometers per hour. The lower half of the bridge has four lanes for trains. The Shanghai-Suzhou-Nantong Railway also started operation on Wednesday. With a designed speed of 200 km/h, the new railway lane will cut travel time between Nantong and Shanghai from 3.5 hours to just over an hour. Commuters between Nantong and Shanghai no longer have to go to Nanjing to transfer. A maximum of 44.5 pairs of passenger trains and six pairs of freight trains will be launched every day. From Nantong, the 143-km railway enters Shanghai through Zhangjiagang, Changshu and Taicang in Jiangsu's Suzhou city. The three county-level cities have been included in the country's railway network since the opening of the railway.

There will be no toll plaza on the 6km section from Cam Hai bridge in Cam Pha to Van Don as that stretch of road was built with State funds.

HONG KONG, Sept. 28 (Xinhua) -- Cross-border buses operated by Hong Kong companies on Friday started trial runs on the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (HZMB) in preparation for the bridge's upcoming opening.

The trial runs, jointly arranged by the governments of the Chinese mainland, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) and the Macao SAR, would last for three days and aimed at testing the readiness of boundary crossing facilities of the three places, the Hong Kong SAR government's Transport and Housing Bureau told Xinhua.

Two major cross-boundary coach trade associations in Hong Kong were invited to send buses and members to participate in the trial runs.

Freeman Cheung, secretary of Hong Kong Guangdong Boundary Crossing Bus Association, said his association would run one bus with about 10 passengers on Friday and Saturday respectively as part of the trial runs.

""Our bus started at noon from the Hong Kong Boundary Crossing Facilities and ran all the way to Zhuhai in about 40 minutes,"" he said, adding that ""the journey was smooth.""

Alan Chan, secretary of another trade association who participated in the trial runs as a passenger, said the clearance procedures at boundary crossing facilities of the three places all went on well and smoothly.

""The boundary crossing facilities of Zhuhai and Macao, in particular, are operated in a collaborative way, which helps remarkably shorten the time needed for the clearance procedures,"" he said.

The HZMB, situated at the waters of Lingdingyang of Pearl River Estuary, is a mega-size sea crossing linking the Hong Kong SAR, Zhuhai city of Guangdong Province and the Macao SAR.

The 55-km bridge is the longest bridge-and-tunnel sea crossing in the world.

The bridge is meant to meet the demand of passenger and freight land transport among Hong Kong, the Chinese mainland and Macao, and to establish a new land transport link between the east and west banks of the Pearl River."	http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-09/28/c_137499775.htm

operation	"A light rapid transit (LRT) train is pictured on a trial run from Kelapa Gading to Rawamangun Velodrome in Jakarta on Monday, Feb. 25. The LRT was expected to begin operation in March after its February launch was delayed.

City-owned transportation company PT LRT Jakarta is set to open a free public trial run for the LRT starting on Monday.

Interested passengers must first register through LRT Jakarta’s official website www.lrtjakarta.co.id/uji-publik.html, where they will be required to fill in their personal information and choose a date to book a seat.

After registering online, they will receive an e-ticket via email. They must bring the e-ticket to exchange for a single-trip ticket at their nearest LRT station.

During the trial run, all five stations – namely North Boulevard, South Boulevard, Pulomas, Equestrian and Velodrome – will be open from 5.30 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day with a headway of 10 minutes.

The LRT spans 5.8 kilometers from Kelapa Gading, North Jakarta, to the Jakarta International Velodrome in East Jakarta.

""The purpose is to familiarise people with this new mode of transportation,"" LRT Jakarta corporate communications manager Melisa Sucianti said on Saturday as quoted by Antara news agency.

The Jakarta administration has yet to set a date for LRT Jakarta’s commercial operation.

Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan previously said he was not in a hurry to officially launch the LRT, saying it would be officiated after it was fully ready.

The standard LRT fare has been set at Rp 5,000 (35 US cents), as stipulated in Gubernatorial Decree No. 34/2019 on MRT and LRT ticket prices. (sau/jun)

operation	"The Abuja light rail train arrives at the airport station in Abuja, Nigeria, July 12, 2018. Nigeria on Thursday formally commissioned the China-assisted Abuja light rail transportation system, the first of its kind in West Africa. (Xinhua/Zhang Baoping)

by Olatunji Saliu

ABUJA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has formally commissioned the China-assisted Abuja light rail transportation system, the first of its kind in West Africa.

Nigerian leader Muhammadu Buhari declared the full operation of the capital city's light rail system, handled by China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) and partly funded by the Export-Import Bank of China.

Buhari, while delivering a keynote address at the light rail's commissioning ceremony, hailed the project as a significant milestone in the history of Nigeria.

""I am very optimistic that a modern rail service would bring about a boost to the FCT (Federal Capital Territory) economy and greatly enhance social life,"" said Buhari, who, thereafter, took a ride on the train.

Local passengers will enjoy a free ride on the train for one month, starting from Friday, said Kong Tao, an operations manager of the CCECC.

Kong said the three available coaches can convey more than 300 passengers on a trip, while at least 1,000 people are expected to daily ride on the train.

With a total length of 45 kilometers, the newly completed Lot A1 and Lot 3 of the light rail are part of the Abuja rail mass transit project.

The light rail was designed to have an interface with the national line at two points, where there would be interchanges to join the rail line linking the northern part of Nigeria.

It covers 12 stations, 21 operational offices, 13 bridges, 50 culverts and nine pedestrian overpasses.

The commissioning was preceded by a three-month test run, during which residents of Abuja beheld the new addition to the country's transportation infrastructure.

Buhari, together with key cabinet members and officials of the Federal Capital Territory Administration, flagged off the light rail transportation from the Abuja Metro Station, located behind the Abuja World Trade Center still under construction in the city center.

The president and co-passengers, including Zhou Pingjian, the Chinese ambassador in Nigeria, rode on the train to the Abuja Airport Terminal at the capital city's Nnamdi Azikwe International Airport.

Forty-year-old Chima Paul, who drove Buhari and others, told Xinhua it was a rare privilege for him to convey the country's very important personalities on his train.

""Apart from that, I am happier because this light rail system is a historic feat happening in my lifetime,"" said Paul.

""I've been driving the train for about three years now after learning from the Chinese. With this now, I can support my family and build a new career for myself,"" said the father of three.

Paul said the Abuja light rail is expected to reduce vehicular traffic and accidents, ensures the durability of the roads and makes transportation of goods, services and people a lot easier.

Nigerians had long anticipated the use of this facility, said Daniel Obot, a local civil servant.

According to him, the local transportation experience in the city of Abuja, the political capital of Nigeria, may never be the same as the train service cuts down travel time and cost.

Abuja, with a population of 4 million, is a relatively new city in Nigeria, but one of the fastest developing cities in Africa.

The construction of the light rail and its use is expected to open up new towns and boost economic activities along the corridor of Gwagwa, Kalgoni, DeiDei, Kubwa, Kokoaba, Dasonga, Asa, among 12 satellite towns in the Nigerian capital city.

For now, only three sets of standard coaches have been provided to cover skeletal services as the main set of the rolling stock is being awaited to make operations cover more passengers.

Sunny Moniedafe, a Nigerian education administrator, described his first ride on the train as ""comfortable.""

""I am seated as if I'm in my parlor and it is moving. Truly, this is commendable. I can see that the journey between the airport and the main city has reduced drastically and it is very comfortable,"" Moniedafe said.

""It is a very good thing. I commend the Chinese government for the relationship with the Nigerian government to make things better for us,"" he added.

operation	"Investor Daily: LRT Jakarta mulai beroperasi, industri properti bersemi

17 December 2019

Jakarta – Jakarta residents has received an alternative public transportation mode after the Velodrome-Kelapa Gading route of Jakarta Light Rail Transit (LRT) is commercially operational on Sunday (1/12), following the operation of Jakarta Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) from April 2019.

Jakarta LRT that spans 5.8 kilometres has six stations, namely Velodrome, Equastrian, Pulomas, South Boulevard, North Boulevard, and Pegangsaan Dua. Jakarta LRT is commercially operational after three test runs in August 2018, March 2019, and June 2019. Jakarta LRT has a fixed tariff for a trip, which is Rp5,000, following Governor Regulation Number 34 of 2019 on Railroad Transport Rates of Mass Rapid Transit and Light Rail Transit.

Rumah.com Country Manager Marine Novita explained that the urban mass transportation increased the price of properties. A new transportation corridor or a change on a mass transportation system will increase the potential for investment in property in that region.

“Operation of the Velodrom-Kelapa Gading route of Jakarta LRT will boost the price of property as it increases connectivity, public access, and shorten travel time. Even though the route is only 5.8 kilometres, Jakarta LRT will boost investment in properties in Rawamangun, Pulomas, and Kelapa Gading,” he explained in his written statement on Sunday (16/12).

Moreover, according to Rumah.com Property Index, property market in Jakarta is showing improvement after being stagnant last year. Rumah.com Property Index recorded that Jakarta property price index was at 131.0 index points, or a decrease of 0.07% (q-o-q) in the third quarter of 2019.

Rumah.com Property Index data has a high accuracy to identify the dynamic that is occurring in Indonesian property market. It is an analysis of 400,000 properties being sold or rented throughout Indonesia. It has more than 17 million pages that are visited every month and accessed by more than 5.5 property seekers every month.

“According to Rumah.com Property Index, the increase is above the average increase between quarters in 2018, which is only 0.2%. Jakarta residential property price increase is 4% yearly. The yearly increase is still the same as last year,” Marine revealed.

The hike in Jakarta property prices, especially in the third quarter of 2019, is caused by public transportation infrastructure development. After MRT is officially operational in April 2019, a test run for the Velodrome-Kelapa Gading route of LRT Jakarta is carried out in June 2019 at Kelapa Gading in North Jakarta and Pulomas as well as Rawamangun in East Jakarta. Since then, Jakarta LRT is now commercially operational.

A relatively stable property index in Jakarta in the third quarter of 2019 is boosted by the increase of property prices in South Jakarta, East Jakarta, and Central Jakarta.

operation	"New Fortress Energy announced that its gas-fired combined heat and power (CHP) plant at the Jamalco Refinery in Halse Hall, Clarendon, officially began commercial operations on March 3, 2020.

New Fortress Energy described the commissioning of the CHP as ""another historic milestone achievement in Jamaica’s transition to natural gas"".

The CHP plant will supply up to 100 megawatts of power into the Jamaica Public Service Company’s national electricity grid as well as provide Jamalco with more than 280,000 pounds of steam per hour, improving the refinery’s energy efficiency.

In commending the company, Minister of Science, Energy, and Technology, Fayval Williams, said; “This is no doubt a symbolic milestone achievement for New Fortress Energy and for Jamaica’s energy sector. We look forward to reaping the benefits of this project as we continue to usher in a new era in energy security and economic prosperity for Jamaica.”

“We are thrilled to announce the completion of the region’s first combined heat and power plant,” said Wes Edens, Chairman and Founder of New Fortress Energy. “A project of this magnitude would not be possible without the collaborative efforts of the government, Jamalco and other key stakeholders, who worked hand in hand with us from the beginning. This tremendous partnership is a great milestone for Jamaica’s economic and environmental progress.”

New Fortress Energy first started Jamaica’s transition to natural gas in 2015 with the build-out of its state-of-the-art liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Montego Bay that converted the JPS 145-megawatt Bogue power plant from diesel to natural gas.

In 2019, NFE and the Government of Jamaica proudly unveiled the historic floating storage regasification terminal (FSRT) in Old Harbour, which provides natural gas to South Jamaica Power Company’s new 190-megawatt gas-fired power plant in Old Harbour and NFE’s CHP plant at Jamalco in Halse Hall.

In addition to providing direct and indirect employment to hundreds of community members, New Fortress Energy, as part of its corporate social responsibility, continues to engage in community upliftment projects in partnership with the community, including road rehabilitation and improvement works, installing streetlights and building sidewalks and embankments."	https://www.loopjamaica.com/content/new-fortress-begins-commercial-operations-jamalco-power-plant
operation	"Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav's ambitious new Agra- Lucknow Expressway will open for commuters on Friday.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav's ambitious new Agra-Lucknow Expressway, which was inaugurated in November, will open for commuters on Friday. Akhilesh, who plans to contest the upcoming Assembly elections in the state on the plank of development, on Thursday also laid the foundation of Purvanchal Expressway project which will connect Lucknow to Ghazipur. With Assembly polls likely to be announced any time now, Akhilesh has been on a ribbon cutting spree since the start of the week and set a record of sorts.

The 302-kilometre-long six-lane expressway, which is India's longest, is expected to considerably reduce the travel time between Lucknow and Delhi which usually takes 12 to 14 hours. The dream project of Akhilesh was inaugurated in Bangarmau by his father and Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav on the eve of latter's birthday at least a month ago.In a first for any road launch, six fighter jets of the Indian Air Force (IAF) on Monday made a touchdown barely skimming the road before taking off to mark the opening of the Agra-Lucknow Expressway which can be also used for war-like emergency situations.

The Agra-Lucknow Expressway, which was built in a record time of 23 months, is expected to reduce the road travel time between Delhi and Lucknow by five to six hours. According to The Financial Express, the Agra-Lucknow Expressway has a design speed of up to 120 kms per hour and will have automatic traffic management systems aimed at reducing road accidents and helping even at the time of fog. The report added that the six-lane expressway is expandable to eight lanes.

At a prepatory meeting, states chief secretary Rahul Bhatnagar met with UP Expressways Industrial Development (UPEIDA) and police officials earlier this week to ensure that the necessary traffic management system, road safety and emergency services are in place. Quoting Bhatnagar, Hindustan Times reported, ""Police officers have been told to provide one police van (Dial 100) and one ambulance (108 service) on every 30 kilometre stretch of the expressway and also set up requisite check posts.""

At the time of inauguration, three Mirage 2000 and three Sukhoi-30 jets of the IAF carried out the 'touch and go' on a portion of the newly constructed Expressway which has an RCC construction and reinforced and appropriately marked to facilitate aircraft landings. The portion used for the operations is located at Ganj Moradabad in Unnao district in Uttar Pradesh. The expressway has an 8-lane bridge across the river Ganga. This will connect Kanpur and Unnao.

The aim of the exercise is to check feasibility of Expressways being used as alternate airstrips in case of dire emergencies or non-availability of runways for any reason, a defence official said.

Reports said that the Expressway includes 4 rail over bridges, 13 major bridges, 57 minor bridges, 74 vehicular underpasses, 148 pedestrian underpasses and 9 flyovers. It also stretches across 10 districts, 236 villages and 3,500 hectares of land.

The Agra-Lucknow Expressway is considered to be a Greenfield project as there were no work constraints of existing buildings or infrastructure. Uttar Pradesh Expressway Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA) purchased almost 3,127 hectares of land without a murmur of dissent and decided to pay four times the circle rates (CR) to the land owners in rural areas and twice the CR in urban parts, as purchase cost. The rest of land was acquired through land acquisition method.

Mulayam, at the time of inauguration, congratulated officials for completing the Expressway in a record two years time along with the chief minister who took personal interest in it.

""At the time of laying of foundation stone of the Expressway, I had asked as to when it will be completed and when four years were asked for its completion I had refused to lay the foundation stone. Later, however, it was done giving 22 months for completing it. The result is before everyone to see that today the road is ready in two years. Earlier, it used to take 12 to 14 hours to reach Delhi and now the distance will be covered in far less time. It will be very beneficial for the people,"" he said. Akhilesh said the project would prove to be an example before the country as no other state had such a vast expressway. ""Samajwadis will go to the polls on the back of such great work,"" the SP chief said.

""When roads are laid they lead to development, this road will connect capitals like New Delhi and Lucknow, it will have industries, petrol pumps and mandis along the route and on returning to power in Uttar Pradesh, the SP government will take this expressway further till Ghazipur and Ballia in record time, it will connect one end of the state to the other,"" he said.

A high-level meeting held in November, which was presided over by the chief secretary Rahul Bhatnagar, it was decided that every 30 km, on both sides of the 302-km long Expressway, a Dial-100 police vehicle and 108 Ambulance would be stationed for any emergencies. It was also instructed that signages and milestones be put up before the route is thrown open for public use. The chief secretary also ordered breath analysers and speed radars to check traffic violators on the Expressway.

Photo: Xinhua/Cheong Kam Ka

A temporary security checkpoint has been set up at the east artificial island on the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge to check personnel and vehicles that enter Macao and Zhuhai via Hong Kong, the Global Times learned from authorities on Monday.The checkpoint, which started operation on December 10 and will remain until December 22, aims to guarantee security and order around the bridge area, and create a harmonious environment for the 20th anniversary of Macao's return to China, authorities said.Police in Macao have joined hands with customs departments to inspect vehicles passing through all entry ports, including the bridge and Cotai, since Tuesday morning.On December 13, a Hong Kong resident surnamed Chung who had been on the run for seven years, was captured at the checkpoint, Zhuhai police said on Monday.Police identified Chung as a key member of a smuggling ring wanted by Shenzhen customs.Shenzhen airport customs issued an arrest warrant for the gang in August 2012 for allegedly organizing truck drivers from Hong Kong and Macao to smuggle cell phones.The arrest came after some Hong Kong media hyped stories which alleged that a Hongkonger went missing after crossing the checkpoint on the bridge.Some critics said the checkpoint targets people from Hong Kong to restrain their movement amid the months-long social unrest in the city, which was triggered by the now-withdrawn extradition bill.They link specific cases to the current complicated situation in Hong Kong in a bid to politicize normal law enforcement.China is a country under the rule of law. Police will never target people from any region. All those who violate Chinese laws, rules and regulations will be dealt with by police according to law and those whose act constitute crimes will be subject to criminal liability, authorities said.All legal passengers and vehicles will not be restricted and will enjoy freedom of movement.The HZMB, 55 kilometers long, opened to traffic on October 24, 2018."	https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1173876.shtml

A giant leap in the infrastructural developments of Uttar Pradesh came this past Monday, 21st November 2016, in the form of inclusion of Agra-Lucknow Expressway in the road transport map of Uttar Pradesh. Agra-Lucknow expressway was inaugurated by Mr. Akhilesh Yadav, Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh.

This 302 kms long 6-lane expressway that will be expanded to 8-lanes in future, promises to deliver a 3.2 hrs of uninterrupted run from Agra to Lucknow, as compared to the seven hours of current journey. In the process, the expressway will cover 10 districts, 236 villages and 3500 hectares of land. The expressway will also pass through 4 National Highways, 2 State Highways, and would cross 5 rivers – Ganga, Yamuna, Isan, Sai and Kalyani.

With so much of trivia already under its proverbial cap, Agra-Lucknow expressway claims another proud distinction. And that is its capability to double up as a Take-Off and Landing strip for the fighter jets of Indian Air Force to operate upon.

This capability has been imparted to Agra-Lucknow highway after Central Government’s plan to upgrade civil highways as Take Off and Landing strips for defence aircrafts. Indian Air Force has already identified about 20 such highway stretches all across India to be used for aircraft operation during “operational contingencies” as well as rescue operations in the face of natural disasters.

8 IAF fighters, 4 of them being Mirage 2000 Multi Role Fighter Jets and 4 Sukhoi 30 MKI Air Superiority fighter jets performed a simulated landing at the designated 3 kms long stretch at Agra-Lucknow Expressway. This should be noted that presence of these two types of aircrafts in any air force is considered crucial in establishing air-ground superiority.

Agra-Lucknow expressway is currently in the final phase of completion and is expected to be open for the public transport by last week of December 2016.

The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has opened the 22.3km long phase 3 of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway project following which commuters wil now be able to reach Hapur from Dasna within 15-20 minutes.

After the inauguration of phase 1 of the expressway, from Akshardham to UP Gate, this is the second stretch on the expressway to be operational.

According to officials, the 22.3 km long stretch, having 10 lanes, was scheduled to be completed by June 2019 but work on the stretch was only completed by August 28, after a delay of two months. The officials said the delay was caused by some restrictions following directions of the National Green Tribunal(NGT) and rains among other factors.

“Phase 3 of the expressway has been opened for commuters and will have a speed limit of 100kmph. The highway comprises 10 lanes and will take commuters to Hapur from Dasna within 15 to 20 minutes,” RP Singh, project director (NHAI), said. “During a speed test, we found that commuters, mostly car drivers, were overspeeding. To check this, we have proposed the installation of speed radars at two locations. The locations would be finalized soon. We have also written to the Hapur traffic police to check overspeeding,” he added.

Phase 3 of the expressway project is pegged at Rs 1,057 crore and has four major structures – a 2.5km long elevated section over the Upper Ganga Canal overbridge near Masuri, a 5km elevated section to bypass Pilkhuwa town, a new toll plaza at Chhajarsi and a flyover near the Hapur bypass.

“The Dasna toll plaza has been removed and a new toll plaza has been put up at Chhajarsi. The toll plaza is proposed for 18 lanes but we have only opened only 16 lanes so far. All the major structures on phase 3 are now operational including the 11 underpasses for heavy vehicles and three underpasses for light vehicles and pedestrians. The Dasna underpass has five lanes that can be used by the local residents, while the Upper Ganga Canal overbridge has three underpasses and one underbridge for vehicles to change sides,” Singh added.

Officials said that long-distance commuters who wish to travel from Delhi to areas such as Hapur, Moradabad and further will benefit from the opening of the phase3.

The NHAI also plans to plant about 8,000 saplings over the entire stretch. The trees will run on each side of the stretch in single rows. The plantation will be paid for by funds apart from the compensatory afforestation fund already paid to the Uttar Pradesh state forest department.

The other phase 2 of the project, which spans from UP Gate to Dasna, will be the next phase that would be operational. The stretch is likely to open in December. Officials expect phase 4, Dasna to Meerut, which be operational around the same time. According to officials, phase 2 is about 58% complete while phase 4 is 55% complete at present.

Phase 2 is proposed to have six expressway lanes beside eight highway lanes, while the phase 4 will be a Greenfield expressway comprising six access-controlled expressway lanes."	https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/phase-3-of-delhi-meerut-expressway-now-open-reach-hapur-from-dasna-in-15-mins/story-u9SLQCFocYkCFGHkvEGIDJ.html

Seven toll plazas on the recently opened Kundli-Manesar section of the KMP Expressway became operational on Wednesday. In a first for the state, the toll at these plazas will be collected on the basis of the distance travelled, Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) officials said.

This section of the expressway was inaugurated on November 19 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and commuters were allowed to use the road without paying any fees till Tuesday when HSIIDC completed the process of awarding the concession to an operator.

HSIIDC officials said Prakash Asphaltings and Toll Highways (PATH) had been given the contract to manage the seven tolls on the 83km stretch.

The KMP Expressway, also called the Western Peripheral Expressway, forms a ring around Delhi, along with the Kundlighaziabad-palwal Expressway, also known as the Eastern Peripheral Expressway. The two are expected to reduce commercial traffic entering Delhi by almost 30%, reducing traffic congestion and pollution.

Over 200 marshals have been deployed at the seven toll plazas to ensure the smooth movement of vehicles and toll operations, officials said. “All the toll plazas are functional, and equipment and systems are in place. However, it will take some time before the entire network comes online and information, regarding the number of vehicles, kind of vehicles, and other traffic details, becomes readily available ,” Vijay Tiwari, an executive with PATH, said.

As per the concessionaire, commuters will be issued a ticket when they enter the plaza, which they have to produce at the time of exit and pay a toll according to the distance travelled on the highway. HSIIDC has fixed a rate of Rs 1.35/km for cars, Rs 2.18/km for light motor vehicles, and a maximum of Rs 6.75/km for heavier vehicles, like multi-axle trucks.

Surender Deswal, executive engineer, HSIIDC, said last week that they had conducted a traffic survey for a few days, from the Kundli-manesar side, in which it was observed that around 12,000 vehicles used the stretch.

“As far as facilities for commuters are concerned, the resting bay, petrol pump and other facilities will come up soon. The contractor has another four months to complete the work. This road will significantly reduce traffic in Gurugram and Delhi,” Deswal added.

PATH is the same company that has been managing the toll operation of the 52km Manesarpalwal stretch since it started operations in 2016. The Madhya Pradesh-based company is presently operating 15 toll plazas across the country."	https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurgaon/7-toll-plazas-begin-operations-on-kmp-e-way-200-marshals-deployed-to-manage-traffic/story-dmybuT3r4pT8DKYuzade3N.html
operation	"Mariscal Sucre International Airport, the busiest airport in Ecuador, is undergoing a $90m expansion and improvement programme to optimise operation and enhance the passenger experience.

Construction for the expansion and improvement programme began in 2017 and is scheduled for completion in 2020.

Out of the total estimated $90m project cost, $60m is being spent on expansion and the remaining $30m for improvements.

In 2017, the airport handled approximately five million passengers. The annual passenger traffic is expected to reach 5.5 million by 2020 and 7.5 million by 2030.

Mariscal Sucre International Airport is owned and operated by privately owned capital firm, Corporacion Quiport under a 35-year concession agreement, which will last until 2040.

Mariscal Sucre international airport background

The new Mariscal Sucre International Airport is situated 20.5km away from the city of Quito. It was built with an estimated investment of $750m. The airport began operations in February 2013 and is currently one of the busiest airports in South America.

In October 2013, the airport underwent the Phase 2a expansion, which included the addition of 5,260m² area, two new passenger boarding bridges, and improvements for cargo operations.

In October 2014, the airport won Silver Award at the P3 (Public-Private Partnership) Awards for Best Operational Project. It also received the Leading Airport in South America award for the third consecutive year at World Travel Awards ceremony in 2016.

Mariscal Sucre’s latest 35-year master plan was approved in October 2015, which calls for further expansion of the airport, including the addition of a second runway.

Mariscal Sucre Airport expansion project details

Expansion and improvement work for the airport is being carried out in nine separate work fronts comprising four expansion projects and five improvement projects.

The cargo platform has been extended with the construction of one additional aircraft parking spot, improving the import and export handling capacity of the airport. The apron parking area for the ground service equipment was also expanded in early 2018.

operation	"Image Source : PTI Delhi-Meerut Expressway to open five months ahead of its scheduled completion date

The second section of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway, from UP Gate till Dasna in Ghaziabad, is set to be commissioned in December this year, about five months ahead of its scheduled completion date.

According to the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), work on the project is 55 per cent complete and will be finished ahead of the targeted May 2020.

The ambitious Expressway has been conceived to provide seamless travel from Delhi to Meerut as well as Hapur in the prosperous western Uttar Pradesh.

Once it is operational, motorists from Delhi will be able to reach Meerut in just one hour, NHAI sources said.

The Expressway's first section, from Sarai Kale Khan in Delhi to UP Gate in Ghaziabad, was completed in June 2018 and it was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The 59.78 km stretch from Delhi to Meerut will be a six-lane double carriage Expressway and can be used after paying toll.

Along this stretch, the distance from Sarai Kale Khan to Dasna will be flanked by four lanes of roads on either which will remain free for use by commuters.

The 22.23-km stretch from Dasna to Hapur will be a six-lane road flanked by two service lanes on either side that will also be free for commuters. Only around 5 per cent of construction work remains to be completed on this stretch.

""There will be three toll plazas along the e-way. It will have three entry and exit points between Sarai Kale Khan and UP Gate. Three more entry and exit points will be provided in Ghaziabad between UP Gate and Dasna,"" a senior NHAI official told IANS.

The section from UP Gate to Dasna, which falls entirely within Ghaziabad, has a couple of issues that has been delaying its progress.

""A water pipeline near Pratap Vihar in Ghaziabad has to be shifted. Also, a Delhi Municipal Corporation toll kiosk that is causing congestion at UP Gate needs to be shifted. We are in talks with the authorities to expedite these works,"" said the official.

The 31.78-km stretch of the Expressway from Dasna to Meerut, which is the final leg of the project, is 52 per cent complete.

Work on four kilometres of this particular stretch has been held up owing to arbitration issues raised against land acquisition by farmers. About 0.48 hectares of land along this stretch is also awaiting forest clearance.

The stretch between Dasna and Hapur, which is not part of the Expressway and which will be toll-free, is 95 per cent complete.

operation	"Delhi-Haryana commuters have a reason to cheer as the Western Peripheral Expressway (WPE), which is also known as Kundli-Manesar-Palwal Expressway is now open for public use.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 19 inaugurated the 83-km-long Kundli-Manesar section of this infrastructure project; the remaining 53-km stretch has been operational since April 2016. The expressway will offer signal-free connectivity to Palwal from Sonepat, bypassing Delhi. The expressway highway together with the Eastern Peripheral Expressway, will divert as many as 50,000 heavy vehicles away from Delhi.

Conceptualisation

The WPE is a partially operational route divided into three 45-km sections. The expressway intersects at the National Highway 44 at Kundli, the National Highway 10 at Bahadurgarh, the National Highway 8 at Manesar, the National Highway 248 at Sohna and the National Highway 2 at Palwal.

The government of Haryana had taken up the task of developing twin projects under the Peripheral Expressway Project, namely the Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE) or the Kundli-Ghaziabad-Palwal (KGP) Expressway and the Western Peripheral Expressway. The two expressways respectively will be bypassing the eastern and western boundaries of Delhi. The Peripheral Expressway Project will be connecting the National Highway 1 and the National Highway 2 from the western and eastern borders, respectively. Once completed, the entire peripheral expressway would form a ring road around Delhi, spanning a total length of 270 kilometres. A major portion of the route of about 183 kilometres passes through Haryana while the rest of the 87 kilometres passes through Uttar Pradesh.

Also known as the National Expressway 2, the EPE is a 135-kilometre six-lane expressway linking Delhi, Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Greater Noida, Baghpat and Sonepat. It consists of two sections — the Palwal-Ghaziabad section and the Ghaziabad-Sonepat section.

Related developments

With the objective to decongest Delhi, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways announced the government’s plan to build several link roads for direct connectivity with the two expressways. Presently, construction of flyovers is underway in areas where the expressway meets the highway. There are 52 underpasses and 23 overpasses on this stretch.

Impact on NCR real estate

A noticeable effect of the creation of the new route will be a significant reduction in the number of heavy vehicles which will now get direct access to industrial towns like Manesar, Sohna, Dharuhera, Bawal and Bhiwadi. Moreover, as far as real estate developments are concerned, the locations such as Gurgaon, Manesar, Ghaziabad, Greater Noida, Palwal, Kundli and Sonepat will see tremendous growth in the coming years. These areas have already established themselves as realty hubs attracting buyers with abundant affordable housing options. Presently, residential properties in these localities have an average price of Rs 3,500 per sqft. The prices are expected to rise while also increasing prospects for better investment returns.

Employment opportunities in the neighbouring industrial towns are likely to draw more real estate developers and investors. Housing options in the above-mentioned localities promise a quality lifestyle for modern homebuyers who not just seek access to basic infrastructure but also sound connectivity. Many prominent players in the realty market have collaborated with smaller builders to launch joint venture projects with enticing features and facilities."	https://www.makaan.com/iq/city/kmp-expressway-opens-on-nov-19-to-reduce-delhi-traffic-congestion-and-heavy-vehicles
operation	"Prime Minister Narendra Modi has inaugurated the Western Peripheral Expressway (WPE), also known as the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal Expressway. Together, the eastern and western peripheral expressway has now formed a ring around the city which will decongest Delhi roads by providing bypass for vehicles not destined for the national capital. The much-awaited expressway which was earlier slated for inauguration in March was delayed due to carpeting work near drains and intersection.

To boost development along the highway, Haryana Cabinet has approved the development of five cities on 50,000 hectares each side of the expressway which would cover eight districts of the state -- Sonipat, Rohtak, Jhajjar, Gurugram, Rewari, Mewat, Faridabad and Palwal. The Cabinet has also given an approval to form the Panchgram Development Authority.

The twin project

As the name signifies, the Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE) bypasses Delhi on the eastern side while the Western Peripheral Expressway (WPE) outlines its western border. The EPE is part of the Peripheral Expressway Project, which includes Western Peripheral Expressway WPE and EPE, connecting the National Highway-1 and the National Highway-2 from the western and eastern side of Delhi, respectively.

The two expressways are dubbed as the first smart and green highway, with an intelligent highway traffic management system (HTMS), video incident detection system (VIDS), electrified by solar panels and faster Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) system at toll booths.

EPE: The expressway is also named as the National Expressway-2 and will provide connectivity between Delhi, Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Greater Noida, Baghpat and Sonipat. It would be a 135-km, six-lane expressway and will have two sections — the Palwal-Ghaziabad section and the Ghaziabad-Sonipat section.

WPE: This stretch is 135-km long and is partially operational. The road has been divided into three sections, each of 45 km. The WPH crosses NH-44 at Kundli, NH-10 at Bahadurgarh, NH-8 at Manesar, NH-248 A at Sohna and NH-2 at Palwal. Almost 15 flyovers will be built at different places along the stretch to facilitate smooth commute.

The journey

While the EPE was scheduled for inauguration on January 26, 2018, the operational date was pushed by five months as the work was incomplete at certain stretches. Land-related issues have delayed the work at Ghaziabad while in Greater Noida, farmers agitation halted the construction for several months due to unfair compensation. For speedy resolution, the NHAI had sanctioned Rs 15 crore to build another side road to connect interior villages of Ghaziabad with the expressway and has asked farmers to withdraw their pending cases. Almost 60 per cent of the work was completed by April 2017 but the continuous problem at the site, mostly related to land settlement delayed the operations at the expressway.

The work progressed in smooth fashion for the western expressway as 50 per cent of the land acquisition cost was borne by the Delhi government. About 95 per cent of the construction work has been finished and would be operational soon. The Manesar-Palwal stretch is already operational since April 2016. Currently, flyovers are being constructed at places where the expressway crosses the highway.

The entire peripheral project would form a ring road around Delhi with a total length of 270 km. While a length of 183 km passes through Haryana, the remaining about 87 km length passes through Uttar Pradesh.

Impact on property market

Real estate developers have used this opportunity well and have managed to cater to the growth potential in these markets. Kundli, Sonipat, Manesar, Palwal, Greater Noida has now grown into fully-developed real estate hotspots where affordable housing options are attracting investors from Delhi. The urbanisation spree has reached these distant NCR regions as a number of retail complexes, commercial hubs have come up along these expressways. Most of the residential projects in these areas are now operational and have an up-market feel.

Property prices

The property prices in these areas range between Rs 2,000-3,500 per sqft. The impact of these upcoming connectivity was also visible in areas such as Raj Nagar Extension, Faridabad, Bahadurgarh, Ballabhgarh where prominent developers launched their housing projects in joint venture with smaller builders. This has lifted the overall standard of living in the town as young investors, businessmen, traders are choosing city-like apartment life over independent bungalows which have all amenities in the society such as club-house, gym, manicured gardens, etc. As a result, these expressways have contributed to fast-catching urbanisation around the NCR."	https://www.proptiger.com/guide/post/eastern-western-peripheral-expressways-have-given-ncr-an-urban-lift
operation	"Bohol-Panglao International Airport is the first eco-friendly airport constructed on Panglao Island, Bohol Province in central Philippines.

The PHP8.9bn ($169m) facility replaced the existing Tagbilaran Airport, the country’s 11th busiest airport.

The new airport’s design complies with international standards and aims to handle the increasing passenger influx in the coming years. Construction was completed in November 2018 and the Bohol airport began operations in the same month.

Built on an area of 216ha, the Panglao airport is a greenfield construction and is ten times bigger than the existing airport. Tagbilaran Airport was built on an area of 850m² and handles approximately 800,000 passengers a year, whereas the new Panglao International Airport can manage two million passengers a year.

Philippines Department of Transportation and Communications, and Regional Development Council Central Visayas jointly developed the new airport.

Aboitiz Group will operate and maintain the airport under a 25-year concession agreement, which was approved by the National Economic and Development Authority (Neda) Board in December 2019.

Bohol-Panglao International Airport design details

Panglao’s new airport is constructed as a tropical airport in accordance with the location of the island and is also planned as a tropical resort. It has a 2,000m runway, a 55,585m² apron, and a passenger terminal building that can accommodate one million passengers a year.

The passenger terminal building is a single-level structure spread over 8,500m² housing both domestic and international operations. The roof of the building is a multi-curved structure that appears to be floating over the building and takes inspiration from Bohol’s Chocolate Hills, a set of unusually shaped hills.

The flight complex has extensive landscaping that is prominent in the external yard of the terminal building.

An external 1,958m² covered area in front of the terminal building is dedicated for sending off and welcoming passengers’ relatives.

The Bohol International Airport has the capacity to accommodate four large jets, including Boeing 777s and Airbus 330s, or seven small jets such as Airbus 321s or 200s.

Facilities at the New Bohol airport

The terminal building houses domestic and international check-in hall, pre-departure lounges, offices for direct passenger-related services and building management, international and domestic baggage claim areas, as well as concession spaces, including duty-free shops.

The public concourse area at the entrance of the terminal building has access to public toilets, car rental, bank and an airline ticketing office. The area is connected to the car park area and the passenger terminal curb.

The Bohol airport complex also includes a control tower, air traffic control (ATC) operation and administration building, fire station and airport maintenance building, ancillary buildings and navigational aids building. Utilities such as powerhouse, water supply system and sewage treatment system are also part of the complex.

Sustainable features of Panglao International Airport

Built as an ‘eco airport’, Bohol-Panglao International Airport is installed with advanced Japanese technology. It features a photovoltaic power generation system and a filtering system that prevents pollution of the surrounding area through drainage during construction. Geotextile sheets are used in the soaking yard to avoid the drainage water from seeping into the surroundings.

The airport features robust sewerage disposal system, solid waste disposal system, and a stable waterworks system.

Other energy-saving features integrated in the airport’s design were installation of LED lights, natural lights and ventilation for most public areas. Air-conditioning is powered by solar energy and is available only in the pre-departure area.

Panglao International Airport expansion

The second phase of the Bohol International Airport expansion project includes expansion of its runway to 2,500m and passenger terminal building to 13,300m² to enhance operational safety at the airport.

The Department of Transportation is planning to build a separate cargo terminal and a parallel taxiway, fuel depot, and fuel hydrant system using the local funds. The plan also includes further extension of the runway to 2,800m.

The Bohol international airport will undergo a PHP3.8bn ($74.4m) project in order to improve passenger flow at terminals, enhance retail and dining experience, and increase the number of flight destinations.

Phase one of the project will include enhancements and installation of internal fit-outs to the existing facilities during 2020 and 2021. Phase two, scheduled between 2026 and 2027, includes optimisation and modification to serve the increased traffic.

Financing for the Panglao airport

A sum of PHP5.862bn ($123.5m) was provided by a Special Terms for Economic Partnership (STEP) loan from the Japan International Cooperation Agency-Overseas Development Assistance (JICA-ODA). The remaining amount was funded by the national government.

Construction of the passenger terminal building, control tower, fire station, drivers’ lounge, car parks, guard house, toll booths, utility and navigational aids buildings, access roads and airport infrastructure, including runway strip and taxiways, were funded through JICA’s loan.

In October 2018, the Department of Finance (DOF) and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) signed an agreement to provide JPY4.37bn ($38.96m) for the second phase of the airport project.

Contractors involved

operation	"The two expressways- Eastern Periphery Expressway and the Western Periphery Expressway were planned in 2003 following the Supreme Court order to form a ring road outside Delhi for channeling non-Delhi bound traffic bypassing the national capital.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday inaugurated the Western Peripheral Expressway (WPE), also known as the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal stretch on Monday. The much-awaited expressway which was earlier slated for inauguration in March was delayed due to carpeting work near drains and intersection.

Once the KMP expressway is thrown open, heavy vehicles will get access to various industrial towns like Maneser, Sohna, Dharuhera, Bawal and Bhiwadi in Haryana without entering Delhi. The expressway will cut down the distance between various northern and western states, along with cutting down carbon emissions in the national capital.

WESTERN PERIPHERAL EXPRESSWAY: SOME INTERESTING FACTS

# The two expressways- Eastern Periphery Expressway and the Western Periphery Expressway were planned in 2003 following the Supreme Court order to form a ring road outside Delhi for channeling non-Delhi bound traffic bypassing the national capital.

PM Modi inaugurated the Eastern Peripheral Expressway on May 27 earlier this year, fifteen years from the date of announcement. The highway was completed in the record time of 17 months as the foundation stone was laid by PM in November 2015.

The 135-km-long Eastern Peripheral Expressway envisages signal-free connectivity between Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Gautam Budh Nagar (Greater Noida) and Palwal.

# The two expressways are dubbed as the first smart and green highway, with an intelligent highway traffic management system (HTMS), video incident detection system (VIDS), electrified by solar panels and faster Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) system at toll booths.

# The stretch is 135-km long and is partially operational. The road has been divided into three sections, each of 45 km. The WPH crosses NH-44 at Kundli, NH-10 at Bahadurgarh, NH-8 at Manesar, NH-248 A at Sohna and NH-2 at Palwal. Almost 15 flyovers will be built at different places along the stretch to facilitate smooth commute.

# A sum of Rs 6,400 crore has been spent on the expressway project and 3,846 acres of land was acquired at a cost of Rs 2,788 crore.

# The design speed of this expressway is 120 kmph for light vehicles and 100 kmph for heavy ones.

# The proposal for the construction of the Western Periphery was made in 2003.

# The project was awarded to KMP Expressways Ltd., a special purpose vehicle of DS constructions, madhucon projects and Appollo Enterprises in 2005. The initial cost of the project was Rs 1915 crore.

# The project missed multiple deadlines and subsequently the then Congress-led government of the state decided to terminate the contract and pay KMP Expressway and lenders Rs 1,300 crore as a termination payment.

# The project was revived in 2014. It was also decided to upgrade the expressway to a six-lane expressway.

# The 53-kilometre stretch between Manesar and Palwal was opened for public use on April 5, 2016.

operation	"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday inaugurated the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) Expressway in Gurugram. While the PM inaugurated the expressway - and questioned the previous governments for the delay, the Congress has questioned the intention of the Centre and state government behind what it claims is hastened inauguration.

Making note of the fact that the expressway was initially meant to be used during the Commonweath Games of 2010, PM Modi rued the numerous delays. ""The previous government had a much different way of functioning. This expressway should have been yours 8 to 9 years back but that never happened. It was meant to be used during CWG but like the corruption in CWG, this expressway too was caught in a web,"" he said.

Prior to the inauguration, Congress had questioned the timing of the event. ""Is the incomplete flyover being inaugurated with an eye on upcoming elections or to make the private company earn Rs 26 crore monthly,"" Congress leader Randeep Surjewala had tweeted.

Claiming that the flyover is incomplete, he said that the government is putting the lives of people at risk. ""Why are you inaugurating a half-completed KMP expressway and putting the lives of passengers at risk. Where is the completion certificate from Consultant and HSIIDC? How can this be opened for operation without inspection by engineers,"" he tweeted.

The 136-kilometres-long KMP Expressway or the Western Peripheral Expressway has been built by the Haryana government. However, the cost of land acquisition, utility shifting and project preparation, etc for both the Eastern Peripheral Expressway (executed by National Highways Authority of India) and Western Peripheral Expressway (KMP Expressway) was borne by the Delhi government, Uttar Pradesh government and Haryana government in the ratio of 50:25:25 respectively.

The expressway links four National Highways number 1, 10, 8 and 2 running through the districts of Sonepat, Jhajjar, Gurugram, Mewat and Palwal. With the expressway being brought into operation, the traffic congestion of the National Capital Region is likely to be eased.

It will provide high speed link to the Northern Haryana with its Southern Districts like Gurugram, Faridabad and Palwal. By taking this expressway, people traveling from North India will not need to pass through NCR. The de-congestion will also reduce pollution in NCR tremendously.

The project initially started in 2006 and was to be developed on Built-Operate-Transfer (BOT) basis and had to be completed by 2009. However, it took 15 years to complete as it missed multiple deadlines.

In June 2012, a new deadline of May 2013 was decided in a meeting between Haryana government, Delhi government and the developer. However, with a delay in construction, the HSIIDC decided to penalise the company in April 2012. Thereafter, the matter went to the courts and the project was put on the back burner.

The lenders led by IDBI bank had served a substitution notice to KMP Expressways for its continued defaults due to which the then Congress government in Haryana decided to terminate the contract and pay the KMP Expressways and the lenders a lump sum amount of Rs 1,300 crore as a termination payment.

However, in 2014, the project was revived and was also upgraded to six-lanes instead of the earlier sanctioned 4-lane. On April 5 2016, the 53-km stretch between Manesar and Palwal was opened for public use.

Earlier, the Prime Minister had inaugurated the Eastern Peripheral Expressway or the Kundli-Ghaziabad-Palwal (KGP) Expressway on May 27 in Baghpat, Uttar Pradesh."	https://zeenews.india.com/india/pm-narendra-modi-inaugurates-western-peripheral-expressway-congress-claims-flyover-incomplete-2156726.html
operation	"Local airlines announced the start of operations at the brand-new Bohol-Panglao International Airport, a project 18 years in the making.

In separate statements, Philippine Airlines, Cebu Pacific Air and Philippines Air Asia said they mounted the successful transfer of flights to Bohol-Panglao Airport. The new gateway replaced the Tagbilaran Airport, which was officially closed on Nov. 27 this year.

Located on Panglao Island in the province of Bohol, the new airport can accommodate up to two million passengers annually, more than double the 800,000 annual capacity of the Tagbilaran Airport.

“This modern airport will serve local and international tourists who would like to experience the beauty of Panglao. It will also address the problem of our growing traffic congestion, and accelerate economic activities in the region. Be assured of this government’s full support, as you make Bohol more accessible to the world through this new airport,” President Duterte said during the inaugural ceremonies led by the Department of Transportation (DOTr) this week.

Construction began in June 2015, however, the project was hit by delays.

The DOTr noted the project was nevertheless completed ahead of a new target schedule after it ordered round-the-clock construction activities.

The airport was dubbed the “Green Gateway to the World,” because its facilities feature environmentally sustainable practices and green technologies.

According to the DOTr, it uses environment-friendly equipment and facilities such as light-emitting diode (LED) lamps, rainwater catchment pond, materials recovery facility, soaking yard, energy-saving air-conditioning systems, management system for hazardous waste and a sewage treatment plant.

Cebu Pacific, which has been operating flights to Bohol since 2004, announced plans to expand.

It said in a statement it would start daily flights between Bohol and Clark International Airport in Pampanga by Dec. 15 this year. It currently operates three daily flights from Manila and daily flights from Cagayan de Oro and Davao via subsidiary Cebgo.

Active	"Work underway on the San Francisco de Borja project in the Zaragoza region

Enel Green Power has started construction of the 24MW San Francisco de Borja wind farm in the Zaragoza region of Spain.

The €26m project, which is located near the towns of Borja and Frescano, will feature seven turbines – five 3.4MW and two with 3.3MW.

San Francisco de Borja will generate around 92.5 gigawatt-hours a year of electricity, Enel said.

The company connected 13 wind farms to the grid in Teruel and Zaragoza provinces in Spain's Aragon region in 2019, with a combined total capacity of 424 MW.

In 2020, it plans to connect 82MW of wind power in both provinces.

Enel Green Power is aiming to have 10.2GW of installed renewable capacity by 2022, compared with 7.4GW at the end of 2019."	https://renews.biz/61463/enel-starts-24mw-spanish-wind-build/

Enel Green Power (EGP), a subsidiary of Italian energy company Enel, has started construction on the 24MW San Francisco de Borja wind farm in the province of Zaragoza, Spain.

Located near the towns of Borja and Fréscano in Zaragoza, the wind farm will be built with an investment of about €26m.

It will be powered by seven turbines, five of which will have 3.4MW of capacity and the remaining two will have 3.3MW of power-generating capacity.

The wind farm is expected to generate about 92.5GWh of clean power annually, which will suffice the energy needs of about 29,000 Spanish homes, while saving more than 61,000 tons of CO2 per year from being released into the atmosphere.

The wind farm is part of EGP’s strategy to decarbonise its generation mix

The San Francisco de Borja wind farm is part of its EGP’s strategy to fully decarbonise its generation mix by 2050.

As per the company’s plan, it aims to reach a milestone of 10.2GW of installed capacity by 2022, compared to 7.4GW at the end of last year, with an investment of about €3.8bn.

Last year, EGP connected 13 wind farms to the grid in Teruel and Zaragoza provinces in Spain’s Aragón region, with a combined capacity of 424MW. In 2020, it aims to connect 82MW of wind power in the two provinces.

Currently, EGP manages more than 7.4GW of renewable capacity in Spain.

Recently, the company has secured a tender to supply 420MW of solar energy in India from the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI). The solar plant will be located in the state of Rajasthan and the tender was awarded under the 2GW Ninth Tranche of the national solar tender.

The solar plant, which is expected to begin operations by the end of next year, will be built with an investment of about $180m.

The project could generate more than 750GWh of clean energy annually, while avoiding more than 680,000 tons of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere."	https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/news/enel-wind-farm-spain/
operation	"The Philippines has opened a new airport on Panglao island which should drive rapid tourism growth for one of the country’s largest and fastest growing holiday destinations. The new Bohol International Airport opened on 28-Nov-2018, replacing Tagbilaran Airport. All three main Philippine airline groups – AirAsia, Cebu Pacific and Philippine Airlines (PAL) – moved their Tagbilaran Airport flights to Bohol International on that date.

Summary:

The Bohol International Airport opened on 28-Nov-2018, replacing the space constrained Tagbilaran Airport;

The new airport is expected to handle 2 million passengers in its first year compared to only 800,000 passengers per year for the now closed old airport;

The new airport is located on Panglao island, which attracts over half of Bohol’s visitors and is an increasing popular holiday destination.

The two airports are a short drive from each other (less than 10km). However, Tagbilaran Airport was much smaller and space-constrained because of its location near the centre of Tagbilaran, the capital of Bohol province. The old airport is being closed and its three letter designator (TAG) transferred to the new airport.

The new airport is expected to generate a significant increase in visitor numbers to Bohol province as accessibility improves. The new airport is expected to handle around 2 million passengers in 2019 compared to only 800,000 passengers per year for Tagbilaran.

TABLE – The now closed Tagbilaran Airport was the 12th largest airport in the Philippines based on weekly seat capacity; the new Bohol International Airport could quickly become the sixth largest based on near term growth projections Source: CAPA – Centre for Aviation & OAG (data: w/c 19-Nov-2018)

The Tagbilaran Airport was operating at capacity while the Bohol International Airport has plenty of space for expansion as it is on a site that is 10 times larger. The new airport is also night rated, enabling Philippine carriers to start operating flights after dark.

Bohol province attracted 1.1 million visitors in 2017. Tourism authorities expect visitor numbers will double to 2.2 million by 2020. About 60% of Bohol visitors stay in Panglao island, which is connected to Tagbilaran city and the rest of Bohol via a short bridge.

Around two thirds of visitors are Filipinos travelling from other parts of the Philippines. However, the new airport is expected to attract new international flights, leading to a surge in international visitor numbers. The only international service at the moment is a PAL flight to Seoul. PAL also has three domestic routes from Bohol – Manila, Clark and Davao – some of which are operated by its subsidiary PAL Express.

Cebu Pacific and Philippines AirAsia compete against PAL on the core Manila route. Cebu Pacific’s turboprop subsidiary Cebgo competes against PAL Express to Davao and also connects Bohol with Laguindingan.

There are no foreign airlines although authorities hope the new airport will attract them along with new international routes from Philippine carriers. Flights to China are an obvious target as China is the second largest and fastest growing source market for the Philippines. China accounted for 27% of foreign visitors to Panglao in 2016 despite the lack of direct flights.

Some visitors to Panglao/Bohol now travel via Cebu, the second largest city in the Philippines where a new international terminal opened earlier this year. The fastest ferry from Cebu to Tagbilaran is only two hours but more direct flights will certainly help attract more visitors. Panglao is known for its beaches and has the potential to become the leading alternative destination to Boracay.

Construction of the new airport began in 2015 and was accelerated under the Rodrigo Duterte administration. Mr Duterte, who has been a strong advocate for new airports and tourism, inaugurated the new airport on 27-Nov-2018. While construction was accelerated a couple of years ago the airport missed an initial Aug-2018 target date for opening, resulting in a three-month delay.

The new airport has an initial capacity to handle around 4 million passengers per year but a terminal expansion and runway extension is already planned to further boost capacity.

Bohol International is being marketed as the first “green” airport in the Philippines. One third of its energy needs are being generated from solar panels. It also uses solar technology to support a hot water system and has a rainwater catchment system that enables the collection and reuse of rainwater."	https://blueswandaily.com/philippines-opens-new-airport-on-panglao-island-boosting-tourism-for-bohol-province/

All its renewable energy construction plans are accompanied by their corresponding Creation of Shared Values (CSV) Plans . CSV plans are designed together with environmental stakeholders and their ultimate objective is to maximise the socio-economic impact that projects have on the community. These CSV plans prioritise, among other actions, the incorporation of local labour, as well as locally hiring catering services and workers’ accommodation.

The construction of this renewable capacity responds to EGP’s strategy to fully decarbonise its generation mix by 2050. According to the company’s latest Strategic Plan, the next milestone is set at reaching 10.2 GW of installed renewable capacity by 2022, compared to 7.4 GW at the end of 2019, with a total investment of around 3.8 billion euros.

EGP currently manages more than 7,452 MW of renewable capacity in Spain.

During the groundbreaking ceremony held yesterday in Marilao, Bulacan for the Advance Contruction Mobilization for Phase 1 of the PNR Clark Railway, DOTr Secretary Arthur Tugade said the government has decided to begin pre-construction works such as site clearing, realignment or relocation of utility lines, as well as acquisition of right of way to get the project moving.

Also gracing the event was Sen. Joel Villanueva, who cited the PNR Manila-Clark project as a boon to economic activity and to commuters.

“The construction of Clark Railway increases connectivity within Metro Manila and the Central Region. Not only will this afford convenience to our commuters, but it will also improve economic activity in the area,” Villanueva said.

The project is seen to ease vehicular traffic in Metro Manila and speed up travel to north of the metropolis, especially key areas of Central Luzon where modern townships are being developed.

Tugade said the DOTr wants to award the general construction contract for the project by April.

The first phase of the PNR Clark Railway covers the 38-kilometer segment from Tutuban in Manila to Malolos in Bulacan.

The Tutuban to Malolos segment, which is also known as the North-South Commuter Railway (NSCR) project, was approved by the National Economic and Development Authority Board in February 2015.

In November of the same year, the Japanese official development assistance loan for the project was signed.

The Tutuban to Malolos segment will have 10 stations and is expected to serve 340,000 passengers daily.

Once the project is completed, commuters from Tutuban are expected to reach Malolos in 35 minutes.

Japan International Cooperation Agency representative Susumo Ito said in the same event the project would be a major game changer in terms of opening opportunities in the economies surrounding of Metro Manila, particularly in the North.

He said the project would enhance mobility of Filipinos and encourage new investments into the country.

“We are confident that NSCR project delivers speedy, safer and more comfortable journeys to many people,” he said.

The Tutuban to Malolos segment is targeted to be partially completed by 2020 and fully operational by 2021. – With Ramon Lazaro"	https://www.philstar.com/business/2018/01/06/1774957/dotr-groundbreaks-manila-clark-rail-project
operation	"Muscat: The new passenger terminal building at Muscat International Airport, which was opened to public a year ago, is already being rated among the best in Asia.

To the credit of all stakeholders, the airport was opened at one go and all operations were nearly seamless. The first commercial flight to land at the new airport was Oman Air’s WY462 from Najaf, Iraq, around 5.30 pm, and a few passengers were lucky to have booked their tickets for the same day. Couple of hours later, the first flight out of the new airport left for Salalah at 7.10 pm.

According to the National Centre for Statistics and Information (NCSI), the airport handled a total of 15,413,15 passengers in 2018, while it has the capacity to handle around 20 million passengers a year.According to Mustafa al Hinai, CEO, Oman Aviation Group: “Our plans for 2019 are to commercially explore the airport as per its strategic advantages. Our main target is to attract more airlines to the country, and develop the land around that will help bring people to the airport.” Work on the rehabilitation of the southern runway of Muscat airport will begin this year, along with the inauguration of a new aircraft maintenance building, an integrated distribution centre for corrosive materials at the airport.

At the glittering event to mark the official inauguration in November 2018, Hinai had said that Oman Aviation Group is working towards a target of 40 million passengers by 2030 and 56 million by 2040. “The phase II of the project is under planning and will be announced at the right time,” he said. Recently, Muscat airport was recognised as the ‘Most Improved Airport — Middle East’ by Airports Council International (ACI) World in its Airport Service Quality (ASQ) Awards, which recognise airports around the world that deliver the best customer experience in the opinion of their passengers. “This airport will add a lot to the economy, and the aim is to rank among the top 20 airports in the world.

The commercial area for non-aeronautical business also increased by 10 times from 3,000 sqm at the current airport to 30,000 square meters,” according to a senior official at Oman Airports. The new cargo building has spread over 32,000 sqm with a capacity to handle 350,000 tonnes of cargo per year, which could be extended to 500,000 tonnes. “This airport is certainly on par with the best in the world in all categories, including top class approach roads leading to the terminals, public transport, parking and e-visa facilities,” said Mohammed Latif, a PR executive based in the UAE, who frequently shuttles between the two countries.

“This is certainly only a beginning, and we hope the airport will get bigger in the coming years,” said Abdullah al Balushi, a senior executive in the oil and gas sector. The Public the authority for Civil Aviation (PACA) has also started addressing the problem of noise caused by aircraft movement without affecting the safety and efficiency of flights. The results of the World Airport Survey, in which Muscat is participating, will take place in London on March 27. Apart from destinations in the Indian subcontinent and the GCC, the airport offers direct flights to UK, Egypt, Iran, Syria, Ethiopia, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Paris, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Italy, Germany, Russia, Philippines and Kenya, Morocco, Azerbaijan and Georgia."	https://www.omanobserver.om/muscat-airport-handles-15m-passengers/
Active	"The San Francisco de Borja wind farm, near the towns of Borja and Fréscano, involves an investment of 26 million euros and will generate 92.5 GWh per year.

Enel Green Power has begun construction of a 24 MW wind farm near the towns of Borja and Fréscano in the province of Zaragoza. The investment associated with this project amounts to 26 million euros.

The San Francisco de Borja wind farm will have 7 wind turbines, 5 of them with a unit power of 3.4 MW and 2 with 3.3 MW, which will generate around 92.5 GWh per year, equivalent to the power used by 29,000 homes. Its commissioning will save 61,270 tons of CO2 per year from being released into the atmosphere.

Enel Green Power connected thirteen wind farms to the grid in Teruel and Zaragoza provinces in Spain's Aragón region in 2019, with a combined total capacity of 424 MW. In 2020, it plans to connect 82 new megawatts of wind power in both provinces.

All its renewable energy construction plans are accompanied by their corresponding Creation of Shared Values (CSV) Plans . CSV plans are designed together with environmental stakeholders and their ultimate objective is to maximise the socio-economic impact that projects have on the community. These CSV plans prioritise, among other actions, the incorporation of local labour, as well as locally hiring catering services and workers’ accommodation.

The construction of this renewable capacity responds to EGP's strategy to fully decarbonise its generation mix by 2050. According to the company's latest Strategic Plan, the next milestone is set at reaching 10.2 GW of installed renewable capacity by 2022, compared to 7.4 GW at the end of 2019, with a total investment of around 3.8 billion euros.

EGP currently manages more than 7,452 MW of renewable capacity in Spain. Of this figure, 4,711 MW comes from conventional hydraulic generation; and the rest, 2,741 MW, comes from wind (2,307 MW), solar (352 MW), mini-hydro (79 MW) and other renewable sources (3 MW)."	https://www.enelgreenpower.com/media/press/2020/07/egp-wind-farm-zaragoza

Construction of the eastern part of Yangon elevated expressway will start in early 2021, said Deputy Director General Kyi Zaw Myint from Road Department under Ministry of Construction in a meeting to discuss about the environmental impact assessment concerning the project in Hlegu Township on February 18.

“The eastern part is from Hlegu, Kyauktan, Thanlyin to Thilawa SEZ and the northern part is from Hlegu, Hmawby to Hlaingthayar. The western part is from Hlaingthayar to Dala and the southern part is from Dala and to Thilawa SEZ. The project is roughly about 130 or 140 kilometers in length. The investment is big as it is a six-lane expressway road. We can estimate the cost after drawing its design. The government and private sector will invest in it,” said the deputy director general.

Investors from private sector will be allowed to collect tolls under build, operate and transfer system. The investment from the government is two types: its budget and development loan. The government will use development loan to implement the expressway project, he said.

“The government will not use the development loan only as the private sector alone cannot afford to implement the project. The project will be implemented step by step. The details of feasibility test are still conducted for the eastern part of the project. After that, the western part will be implemented. The western part will be connected with Yangon new town plan. Two parts may be joined together. We are still making negotiation,” he said.

They will announce the types of investment after conducting feasibility test on the southern and northern parts of the project, he continued.

“We are still analyzing the project and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) is helping us. We will decide which part the private sector will be implemented and how much the government can spend the budget. They may take the Japanese loan from the overseas development assistance (ODA). The project will be implemented in 2021 as it cannot be earlier than that we have to make step by step the process,” he said.

Entailing the construction of a new supercritical coal-fired power plant with a generation capacity of 1,320 MW (two 660 MW power-generation units) in the Van Phong Special Economic Zone in Vietnam’s Khanh Hoa Province, the Project is a build-operate-transfer (BOT) power generation project that will sell electricity to Vietnam Electricity (“EVN”), Vietnam’s state-owned power company, over a period of 25 years. Total project costs should reach about 280 billion yen, and the plant is scheduled to start commercial operation by the end of 2023.

Vietnam’s electric power demand has risen sharply in line with rapid economic growth, and resolving the serious power shortages expected in future has become a pressing issue. Under its revised National Power Development Plan VII originally formulated in 2016, the Vietnamese government is striving to meet power demand growing about 10% annually by stepping up its power generation capacity to 96,500 MW by 2025 and to 129,500 MW by 2030.

Climate change issues have now become important social issues, and efforts are being pursued worldwide to expand the use of renewable energies and otherwise alleviate climate change. The Sumitomo Corporation Group has revamped its policies toward climate change issues accordingly. As it works to reliably supply the energy essential to economic and industrial development in local communities, the Group’s power generation business will adopt such approaches as incorporating renewable energy into the Group’s own management resources as part of a sustained shift toward a power generation portfolio with a lower environmental impact. While the Group’s general policy is to refrain from building new coal-fired power plants, it has decided to make case-by-case assessments of projects deemed essential for the economic and industrial development of local communities that conform to policies established by Japan and the host country with due consideration for international efforts and trends toward mitigating climate change, and it was on this basis that this project was undertaken.

Sumitomo Corporation remains committed to dependably supplying the energy vital to economic and industrial development in Vietnam and to helping improve living standards and resolve power shortages in Vietnam.

Active	"Sumitomo Corporation has recently commenced construction in Vietnam on the 1.2 GW Van Phong 1 coal-fired power project in which it is involved through its wholly-owned subsidiary Van Phong Power Company Limited.

Entailing the construction of a new supercritical coal-fired power plant with a generation capacity of 1,320 MW (two 660 MW power-generation units) in the Van Phong Special Economic Zone in Vietnam’s Khanh Hoa Province, the Project is a build-operate-transfer (BOT) power generation project that will sell electricity to Vietnam Electricity (“EVN”), Vietnam’s state-owned power company, over a period of 25 years. Total project costs should reach about JPY 280 billion (USD 2.6 billion), and the plant is scheduled to start commercial operation by the end of 2023.

Vietnam’s electric power demand has risen sharply in line with rapid economic growth, and resolving the serious power shortages expected in the future has become a pressing issue. Under its revised National Power Development Plan VII originally formulated in 2016, the Vietnamese government is striving to meet power demand growing about 10% annually by stepping up its power generation capacity to 96,500 MW by 2025 and to 129,500 MW by 2030.

Climate change issues have now become important social issues, and efforts are being pursued worldwide to expand the use of renewable energies and otherwise alleviate climate change. The Sumitomo Corporation Group has revamped its policies toward climate change issues accordingly. As it works to reliably supply the energy essential to economic and industrial development in local communities, the Group’s power generation business will adopt such approaches as incorporating renewable energy into the Group’s own management resources as part of a sustained shift toward a power generation portfolio with a lower environmental impact. While the Group’s general policy is to refrain from building new coal-fired power plants, it has decided to make case-by-case assessments of projects deemed essential for the economic and industrial development of local communities that conform to policies established by Japan and the host country with due consideration for international efforts and trends toward mitigating climate change, and it was on this basis that this project was undertaken.

Upon commissioning of all 16 generating units, the 6GW Grand Renaissance hydroelectric power station is expected to generate approximately 15,000GWh of electricity a year.

Location and river details

The Grand Renaissance hydropower project is located on the Blue Nile, which is a major tributary of the world’s longest river the Nile River contributing up to 80% of its water during the rainy season.

The Blue Nile originates at Lake Tana in north-western Ethiopian Highlands and runs for approximately 1,450 km to meet another major tributary the White Nile in Khartoum, Sudan.

The Grand Renaissance Dam is being built at a narrow point on the Blue Nile approximately 40km downstream of its confluence with the River Beles and approximately 15km upstream of the Ethiopian-Sudan border.

The project site is located approximately 500km north-west of capital Addis Ababa in the Benishangul-Gumaz region of Ethiopia.

The Grand Renaissance hydropower station components

The Grand Renaissance hydroelectric facility comprises a concrete gravity dam on the Blue Nile River with a storage capacity of 70 billion cubic metres (bcm) of water, one outdoor powerhouse on each bank of the river, three spillways, and a saddle dam.

The powerhouse on the right bank will be equipped with ten 375MW Francis turbine generator sets while the left bank powerhouse will have six similar capacity turbine generators. Each turbine will be driven by the water flow through an 8m-diametre, 180m-long penstock.

Grand Ethiopian Renaissance dam details

The main dam of the Grand Renaissance hydroelectric power project will be a 1,780m-long and 155m-high roller-compacted concrete (RCC) gravity dam which will create up to 1,680km² of reservoir area.

The river diversion system for the project includes four 210m-long and 8m-wide box culverts with a total discharge capacity of 14,700m3/s.

The project also involves a 5km-long, 60m-high concrete faced rockfill (CFRD) saddle dam with an embankment volume of approximately 17m3.

Power transmission

The electricity generated at the hydroelectric facility will be stepped up to 500kV and transmitted through overhead lines connecting to a 500kV double bus-bar switchyard located downstream on the right river bank.

Contractors involved

Salini Impregilo (now Webuild Group) is the main construction contractor for the dam project, while Ethiopia’s military-controlled Metals & Engineering Corporation (METEC) was contracted for electromechanical and hydraulic steel structure work for the power station.

Mambilla hydropower project development history

Although Mambilla hydroelectric project was originally conceived in 1972, it could advance only after 35 years when China’s Gezhouba Group awarded a contract to develop the project with 2,600MW installed capacity in 2007.

The ground survey for the project was completed in August 2010 and environmental approval was received in December 2011.

The capacity of the project was increased to 3,050MW in 2012. The project was, however, put on hold due to administrative clashes, until it received government approval in 2016.

Nigerian Federal Ministry of Power Works and Housing awarded the project development contract to a consortium of three Chinese companies including the Gezhouba Group, in November 2017.

Mambilla hydropower plant make-up

Mambilla hydroelectric facility will comprise four dams and two underground powerhouses having 12 turbine generator units in total.

The four dams to be constructed on the Dongo River for the Mambilla hydropower project include Nya (formerly known as Gembu), Sumsum, Nghu and Api Weir dams.

Nya and Sumsum will be 100m and 35m-tall roller compacted concrete (RCC) dams with crest length of 515m and 460m, respectively.

Nghu will be a 95m-high rockfill dam with a crest length of 650m, while Api Weir will be a small regulatory dam to raise the water level of the river.

Nya and Sumsum dams will be connected through a 16km-long, 6m-diameter tunnel, whereas Sumsum and Nghu dams will be connected by a 1.5km-long and 10m-wide canal.

The headrace canal for the plant will be 3.1km-long and 15m-wide.

Each underground power house of the plant will measure 175mx27mx38m and house six 250MW Pellton turbine units operating at a total dynamic head of 1,007m.The diameter of the power shafts connecting each turbine will range between 5.25m and 8.40m.

Two 6km-long tailrace tunnels for the plant will be of 8m diameter each, while the tailrace canal will be 3km-long and 25m-wide.

Active	"Dam in Stiegler's Gorge, Morogoro Region, Tanzania

Julius Nyerere Hydropower Station (JNHS), also called Rufiji Hydroelectric Power Station, is a 2,115 megawatts (2,836,000 hp) hydroelectric dam under construction in Tanzania.[2] The power station is expected to produce 5,920GWh of power annually.[3][4][5]

Overview [ edit ]

The government of Tanzania has been considering establishing this power station since the 1960s. When fully developed, it will be the largest power station in East Africa. The 134 metres (440 ft) arched, concrete dam is expected to create a reservoir lake, 100 kilometres (62 mi), in length, measuring 1,200 square kilometres (460 sq mi), with 34,000,000,000 cubic metres (1.2×1012 cu ft) of water.[6]

History [ edit ]

In 1901 German Engineer Stiegler led the first expedition to what is now known as Stiegler's Gorge to consider potential infrastructure. Stiegler, when measuring the gorge, was charged by an elephant and fell into the ravine.[7] It was named after him in his memory. Plans for a dam were developed during British rule of Tanganyika. Alexander Telford[8] conducted the first systematic development surveys of the Rufiji in 1928–1929, with engineer C. Gilman carrying out further studies in 1938–1940.[9] These studies primarily envisioned irrigation infrastructure with a small dam at Stiegler's Gorge to reduce flooding and protect downstream irrigation infrastructure.

This changed in the 1950s when the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) started studying Rufiji River infrastructure. This included a far larger dam wall of around 100 metres (330 ft) that aimed to transform the valley to an artificial environment, providing water for agriculture. The FAO's report was published in 1961 and envisaged 200,000 hectares (490,000 acres) of irrigation.[9]

Plans turned towards hydropower after Tanganyika's independence in 1961. President Nyerere saw hydropower dams as key deliverers of his ambitious modernisation programme. From the 1969-1974 Second Five-Year Development Plan, this modernisation plan increasingly aimed for industrialisation and therefore needed cheap electricity.[8] This understanding of dams as developmental and of their ability to deliver cheap electricity, drove the Great Ruaha Hydropower Project with involved hydro-plants at Kidatu and Mtera.[10] The Ruaha is an upstream tributary of the Rufiji.

Planning for the Stiegler's Gorge project advanced with three donor organisations. The Japanese External Trade Organization supported feasibility studies in the 1960s that proposed a 620MW plant. At the same time, Nyerere's government engaged US Authorities and in particular the Bureau of Reclamation and Tennessee Valley Authority. This produced studies planning wider transformation of the Rufiji valley, with the dam enabling irrigation, industrialisation, urban water supply and a large fishery in its reservoir.[9][8] The US studies also initiated the creation of the Rufiji Basin Development Authority (RUBADA), whose founding mission was to build the dam and facilitate the wider development of the valley.[8] By the 1970s, the Norwegian NORAD development agency had taken on the Stiegler's Gorge Planning, producing detailed feasibility and construction designs.[9]

However, these plans were never implemented. This is primarily because of the World Bank's decision to reject project finance. In the 1980s, the Bank was the major financier of dams in developing countries and particularly significant in Tanzania, which was enduring an economic crisis at the time.[11] The World Bank questioned the need for Stiegler's Gorge, given their calculation of limited growth in electricity demand[9][12] . There were also growing environmental concerns around the project, prompting the first Environmental Impact Assessment in Tanzania.[9][13] These concerns were magnified by the designation of the Selous Game Reserve, in which the gorge sits, as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1982. The World Bank and other international donors consequently turned to the smaller and less-impactful Kidatu and Pangani Falls Dams in the 1990s.[14]

However, Kikwete's government resurrected plans for the dam in 2006. This came with the country's emergence from economic crises in the 1980s and 1990s to a period of sustained economic growth.[11] The resurrection of the project also reacted to a severe power crises in Tanzania from 2004-2006 that saw widespread load shedding.[15] Maximising the fiscal advantage of the country's increasing economy, early speeches by government ministers in 2006 indicated that the Stiegler's Dam would be a priority. The Minister of Energy and Minerals also confirmed the dam's status in the 2009 Power Sector Master Plan. The decision gave renewed purpose to Rubada, the agency tasked with implementing the dam, who started actively lobbying for the project and meeting companies.[16]

A series of companies expressed interest in developing the project. Under Kikwete's government, and like other energy sector projects, the dam was supposed to be developed by the private sector. This involved unsolicited bids by private companies for agreements with the government to build the project. The companies would then use these deals, such as power purchase agreements, to raise finance and start construction. The first such bid was made by IDF (Infrastructure Development Finance Ltd) of South Africa and Energen of Canada in 2006–2008.[17] Sinohydro also reportedly placed a bid around 2008.[16]

However, the main engagement came from Brazil. After meetings between Brazilian diplomats and Tanzanian ministers, including the visit of Brazilian President Lula to Tanzania in 2010, both governments agreed to support Stiegler's Gorge Dam's construction.[16] A number of exchanges between the two countries happened between 2009–2012. This supported the Brazilian company Odebrecht. They signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Rubada in 2012 to build the dam. Odebrecht also undertook feasibility and design studies and commissioned an environmental impact report.[18] However, Tanzanian interest in the dam appeared to stall by 2014, delaying any implementation.

This changed when President Magufuli came to power in 2015. In 2017, he announced that the Stiegler's Gorge Dam would be a flagship development project of his government and would be financed by the government rather than developed by the private sector.[19] A first round of bidding for the construction tenders was held in the autumn of 2017. This was unsuccessful, initiating a second round in spring 2018. Arab Contractors and Elsewedy, both Egyptian firms, won the bid. Magufuli has been vocal in denouncing any critics of the dam[20] and his interior minister threatened that opponents would be jailed in a public speech.[21]

Location [ edit ]

The power station would be located across the Rufiji River, in the Stiegler's Gorge, in the Selous Game Reserve, Pwani (Coast) Region, approximately 220 kilometres (137 mi), by road, southwest of Dar es Salaam, the commercial capital and largest city of Tanzania.[22]

This power station is located in Selous Game Reserve, one of the world's largest World Heritage sites, measuring 45,000 square kilometres (17,000 sq mi). The power station and reservoir lake are planned to occupy approximately 1,350 square kilometres (520 sq mi), within the game reserve.[6]

Construction [ edit ]

In August 2017, the Tanzanian government advertised for bids to construct this dam. The selected contractor is expected to complete the dam in no more than 36 months.[23][24] The power generated will be evacuated via a new 400kV high voltage power line to a substantiation where the power will be integrated into the national electricity grid.[25] The government of Ethiopia is advising the Tanzanian government on the implementation of this project.[26]

In December 2018, The Citizen (Tanzania) newspaper reported that the government of Tanzania had awarded the construction contract for this power project to Arab Contractors Limited of Egypt, at a budgeted cost of US$2.9 billion (TSh6.558 trillion).[27]

Shortly before this, the World Heritage Committee reiterated its grave concern about Tanzania's decision to move forward on the project and added it to the grounds for the Selous Game Reserve to be on the List of World Heritage in Danger, which was previously concerned with elephant poaching.[28]

In February 2019, the government of Tanzania handed over the construction site to the consortium comprising Arab Contractors and El Sewedy, both of Egypt, who had been selected to build the power station. Allowing six months to mobilize equipment, actual construction is expected to start in the 3rd quarter of calendar year 2019.[29] In April 2019, the Tanzanian government made an upfront payment of US$309.645 million, representing approximately 15 percent total cost of construction.[30][31] As of June 2020, the project is 40 percent complete.

Latest design and the Start of Construction [ edit ]

In July 2019, the EastAfrican newspaper, quoting British Broadcasting Corporation, reported that construction of the power station had begun. The dam will be fourth largest in Africa and ninth largest in the world.[1]

In 2018, a new design for Stiegler's Gorge Dam was unveiled.[32] A 131m high and 700m wide dam wall is under construction. The hydropower plant is planned to have an installed capacity of 2,115 megawatts.[33] If completed on time in 2022, this would be Africa's largest dam by installed capacity, over Egypt's Aswan High Dam (2100 megawatts) Mozambique's Cahora Bassa Dam (2075 megawatts) and Angola's Lauca Dam (2069 megawatts).[34][32]

At 2,115 megawatts, the dam's contribution is more than the current peak demand of Tanzania. The country's highest recorded power demand was 1051.27 megawatts in February 2017. Installed capacity has been reported to be between 1366.60 megawatts[35] and 1,602 megawatts.[36] The Stiegler's Gorge Hydropower Project will therefore significantly increase the installed capacity on-grid in Tanzania, supporting power for industrialisation and electrification.

A key rationale for new electricity generation are Tanzania's regular electricity crises. The majority of Tanzania's power shortfalls occur in the dry season and in below-average rainfall years, this causes electricity shortages which are socially and economically damaging. For instance, load shedding between 2014-2015 supposedly cost between 5-7% of Tanzania's GDP.[37]

In preparation for the start of construction, Magufuli ordered Tanesco to prepare the site.[32][19] Contracts were awarded to clear the construction area, prepare a road for large vehicles and provide power and water[38][39][40] . The government also handed out rights to log the large reservoir area, which could bring in significant revenue.[41][42]

The contracts to build the dam were given to two Egyptian firms after diplomatic negotiations between Tanzania's President Magufuli and Egypt's President Sisi[43][44] . El-Mokawloon El-Arab, a military-owned Egyptian firm will undertake the civils works while El Sewedy will install the electro-mechanical equipment including the turbines, generators and transmission lines[34][45][46] . They signed contracts with the state-owned energy utility company TANESCO. The government has publicly stated that the dam will be financed by Tanzania's national budget, yet no funding package was announced and the World Bank and other financiers rejecting support for the dam.[32][34] Elsewedy have secured a loan of $500 million from the African Export-Import Bank,[47] with guarantees from the United Bank for Africa and CRDB Bank, which they plan to repay through the project contract. After the allocation of a portion of the national budget for the project in 2018, in February 2019, the government will officially hand over to the contractors.[48][49][36][38]

Construction Risks [ edit ]

The Stiegler's Gorge Dam's financial costs are contested. When Odebrecht rewrote feasibility and design studies for the dam in 2013, they estimated that it would cost £3.6 billion.[50] The government used this figure in announcing the new design and feasibility study in 2018. However, Hartmann[51] claims the underlying costs have changed, in the price of concrete and construction costs and in engineering services. Using contemporary dam cases, he suggests that, after excluding socio-environmental mitigation, the current cost estimation should be US$7.57billion, rising to US$9.8billion if a conservative amount of overrun is factored in.[52][53]

Tanzania has not announced any funding agreements for the dam's construction. Given the country's economy and tax base, there are doubts about whether the government has sufficient revenue to build the dam.[32] These are particularly relevant given specific outstanding debt issues with the electricity utility, who has signed the contracts for the Stiegler's Gorge Dam's construction[54][55][56] . This financial situation could delay or stop payments to the contractors which would harm or derail construction.

Additional risks come from the choice of the two contractors. According to their public profiles, Dye claims that neither company has had experience of dam construction, and rather primarily builds commercial and residential buildings and transmission lines.

This is deeply surprising given both companies inexperience. Arab Contractors reportedly worked on Aswan Dam in the 1960s, but would only have been one of many sub-contractors on the Russian-led project. A review of their website reveals that the company has been involved in the construction of buildings over the last decade, not on any large hydraulic or power-generation projects. Meanwhile Elsewedy appears mainly to have built transmission lines, not complex electro-mechanical systems.[34]

This lack of experience is notable given the size of Stiegler's Gorge Dam and the degree of hydrological flux in the Rufiji River. There has not been a supervising, 'owner's engineer' appointed to ensure the quality of construction.

This contracting arrangement and the appointed companies entail important risks. Some of these are technical, concerning the construction of a project that stands up and functions (producing electricity) for the intended 50 years. This will depend on the accuracy and rigour of hydrology, sediment, climatic and hydropower studies and the engineers' ability to accurately implement complex designs.[32] There would also be a project management issue in undertaking infrastructure on this scale with recruitment estimated at 4000[50] plus personnel and a number of sub-contractors.[34] Neither company appears to have experience of management on this scale. In its most extreme sense, this raises questions about dam safety, both in the construction phases and in the end product. A number of dam collapses such as the St. Francis Dam (USA) or Malpasset Dam (France) stemmed from poor studies and insufficient engineering standards.

Another risk concerns environmental and social impacts. Given inexperience, the companies are unlikely to be familiar with mitigation codes of practice that could limit impacts, e.g. stopping dumping of soil in the river or in handling waste. There are also concerns over dam safety for workers, given the long history of accidents on dam projects before extra industry efforts in the 21st century.[57][58][59]

There are also significant concerns over poaching which has been a longstanding issue in the Selous Game Reserve.[60] Poaching was the primary reason for placing the UNESCO World Heritage Selous Game Reserve on a list of endangered sites.[61] The increased presence of people and steady flow of construction traffic, as well as logging camps, provides substantive opportunities for poaching and smuggling, especially if the companies do not have knowhow to enforce anti-poaching measures.[62] Thus, the choice of the contractors magnify the pre-existing risks of undertaking the Stiegler's Gorge project.

Risks to operation [ edit ]

There are a number of risks to the effective functioning of the Stiegler's Gorge Hydropower Project, if it is completed. One of these comes from climate change. It is unclear if the total rainfall in Tanzania will increase or decrease, but studies suggest that precipitation's variability will increase.[63][64] This is important as it will affect hydropower production, decreasing the dam's electricity-generation reliability. This is particularly important in the context of hydro-dependency. Tanzania gets the majority of its electricity from hydropower. A failure in these dams in the dry season is the key reason for the country's power failures, which happen frequently.[65][66][64] This vulnerability will increase if the Stiegler's Gorge Dam is completed. If brought online today, a failure of the Stiegler's Gorge Hydropower Plant would reduce power production by 58.3%.

The other risk comes from sedimentation. A report[16] highlighted the vulnerability of the reservoir to rapid sedimentation. This is because of the existing sediment load in the Rufiji River and the high levels of erosion likely to occur around the reservoir. Higher sedimentation would decrease the reservoir's capacity to store water. Such a reduction would reduce the reliability of the reservoir, as it would make it more directly dependent on precipitation.

Another fiscal danger comes from the ability of Tanzania's electricity utility, TANESCO, to sell the hydro-plant's energy. Given Tanzania's current peak capacity of around 1.05GW and installed capacity of 1.5GW, there are persistent doubts about whether Tanzania can sell the dam's energy. A number of reports cast doubt on the ability of the Tanzanian economy and electrification schemes to absorb the dam's demand.[16][67] Without such sales, the government will not easily recoup their investment. These reports also suggest that selling to the regional grid, to neighbouring countries through the Southern and Eastern African Power Pools, is unlikely to work given that both trading schemes are insufficiently institutionalised. There also appears to be a high level of distrust between countries when it comes to relying on others for power.

Negative Impacts [ edit ]

Academics and consultants have established the Stiegler's Gorge Dam's impacts. They have argued that the significant level of environmental and social effects constitute an important trade-off in pursuing Stiegler's Gorge Dam.[67][16][8][9]

Environmental impacts [ edit ]

The key controversy of the proposed Stiegler's Gorge project concerns its environmental impacts. An obvious concern is the location of the gorge in the middle of the Selous Game Reserve World Heritage Site. Firstly, the dam will flood over 2.2% of the reserve's total area, roughly equivalent to the size of Andorra, reducing its forest and riverine habitat.[68][69]

Additionally, the dam project would be directly above the main area of biodiversity in the reserve. This consists of a large wetland, marsh and savanna area. The Rufiji River plays a central role in creating this environment.[16][60] In the wet season, this river has a particularly strong hydrological surge. This force of water during the wet season changes the Rufiji River's path, creating a shifting pattern of oxbow lakes, dried river channels and wetland. Collectively this creates a rich habitat contrasting with surrounding dry savannah.[70]

The Rufiji River has a strong seasonal variation. In the wet season, it floods a large area of land, irrigating the soil and spreading nutrient sediments. The wet season also refills and connects lakes in the Selous Reserve.

Building a dam will change this seasonal river pattern and withhold sediment. It will create a more constant hydrological discharge, reducing the wet season flood. This will undermine the ecological irrigating and fertilising services of the river. The Stiegler's Gorge Dam will therefore harm the wetland areas of the Selous and the wide variety of mammal and bird life that use it, including numerous waders, storks and herons as well as hippo and crocodiles. Large, land-based mammals from elephants to lions also benefit from the presence of the water, particularly in the dry season.

The Selous contains a number of endangered species, including white and black rhinoceros, lion, cheetah, Sanje crested Mangaby, wetland crane, lesser kestrel, Udzungwa red colobus monkey, Udzungwa forest partridge and rufous-winged partridge. Impact assessments indicate these could be affected by a future project.[71][68][16][69][72]

The dam will mean that downstream oxbow lakes are cut-off, become more saline from evaporation and will reduce in size.[9] Cutting-off the lakes will also prevent the regeneration of fish stocks, particularly migratory fish. A study by Duvail et al. found that these negative impacts would occur even with a mitigating flood release of 2,500cms.[73] For instance, this proposed water release would end at least two of the downstream lakes.

Below the Selous Game Reserve is the Rufiji River Delta. This delta area, including Mafia Island, is protected by the highest international level of wetland protection, called the Ramsar Convention. The ecology of this area also depends on the river's seasonal nature.[16][74] The wet season's river-water surge counteracts the saline sea, maintaining a balance of salinity in the delta that underpins its current plant and animal mix. This salinity balance supports the largest mangrove stand in East Africa.[75]

The river's wet season surge, because it brings a large volume of fertile sediments, also supports an algal bloom in the ocean delta. This bloom spawns a rapid annual explosion in plankton, which in-turn supports a rapid increase in fish. Migratory whale sharks and other animals also visit the delta area in the wet season to specifically take advantage of this bloom.

By altering the river's flow and withholding sediment, the dam will therefore damage the UNESCO Selous Site, downstream lakes and the Ramsar-protected delta area.

Social Impacts on Livelihoods [ edit ]

Impacts on the environment will have important socio-economic effects. The river's annual irrigating and fertilising flood creates a rich area of farmland below the park. Typically, this supports recession agriculture that takes place in the dry season. Indeed, the Rufiji valley contains some of Tanzania's richest farmland, including extensive paddy fields. People living in the valley also utilise lakes which are replenished by annual floods. These lakes provide a source for irrigation and a useful fish stock. Therefore, a change caused by the dam will negatively impact people's livelihoods downstream.[72]

Another key impact is on fishing in the Rufiji River delta. This area is Tanzania's economically-richest fishery, centred on prawns. Prawns and other fish numbers are underpinned by the river's wet season pulse.[68] Building the Stiegler's Gorge Dam will therefore harm fisheries around the Rufiji delta.[8]

Another direct impact of the dam will be on tourism. This will be twofold. The main photo-tourist area of the Selous is the part of the reserve immediately below the gorge. The remainder of the park is for hunting tourism and will be negatively affected by construction. The building of the dam will bring a visual impact on this area because of the improved roads and large number of vehicles transporting materials to the dam.[76] The hydropower plant will also require transmission lines.[71] The Beho Beho Hills will visually shield the dam itself. Regardless, the short and long-term negative impacts on the wildlife of the park will undermine the reason for hunting and photo tourism.[33]

Particularly large Rufiji floods can significantly damage the communities living along the Rufiji River.[68] This happened in 1968 for instance when floods destroyed crops, houses and infrastructure. However, research demonstrates that many people living in the valley value such large floods, seeing them as a blessing in the longer term, not a plague.[69][9] This is because of a perception of the floods as agriculturally important. Floodwater spreads more sediment creating rich agricultural conditions in for the following years.[9][9][69]

Tanzania’s Kinyerezi II power plant will be commissioned in the next few weeks.

The country’s first combined cycle power plant is expected to add over 240MW to the national power grid on completion.

According to Shoji Watanabe, the project general manager, the power generated by the plant will be enough to cater for nearly 20 per cent of the country’s total power needs.

The power plant will use six Mitsubishi Hitachi H-25 gas turbines and generators to produce electricity.

The $344 million project is funded 85 per cent by Sumitomo Mitsui Banking and Japan Bank for International Co-operation, while the government of Tanzania covers the rest of the cost.

As of May, Tanzania’s installed capacity was 1,517.47 MW against a demand of 1,100MW.

Kinyerezi I, which is already operational, generates 150 MW, with a target of 335MW by February 2019.

Tanzania is also building two new gas-fired plants — Kinyerezi III, with a capacity to generate 600MW and the 450MW Kinyerezi IV — bringing the total capacity at the Kinyerezi complex to 1,625MW.

Dr Alexander Kyaruzi, chairman of the Tanzania Electric Supply Company (Tanesco) board, said the proven natural gas reserves of 57.54 trillion cubic feet will deliver 5,000MW by 2020 and 10,000MW by 2025.

In addition, Tanzania plans to launch construction of a $2 billion hydroelectricity power and Stiegler’s Gorge station before the end of the year. The plant will add 2,100MW to the national grid.

President John Magufuli said last year that the country need to invest about $46.2 billion over the next 20 years to give a face-lift to its ageing energy infrastructure and meet soaring electricity demand."	https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/business/new-plant-to-add-240mw-to-tanzania-grid-1403670

The Karot Hydropower Project is an under construction run-of-river concrete-core rockfill gravity dam in Pakistan, with a planned installed capacity of 720 MW. It is the first investment project of the Silk Road Fund, and is part of the much larger China–Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) [1].

The plant is expected to be completed by the end of 2021.[2]

Location [ edit ]

The Karot Hydropower Project is planned on Jhelum River near Karot village, some 1.7 kilometers upstream of Karot Bridge and 74 km upstream of Mangla Dam. The Project site is accessible through the Islamabad – Kahuta – Kotli road, approximately 29 kilometers from Kahuta, and 65 kilometers from Islamabad.

History [ edit ]

The Jhelum River is the largest river of Indus Basin River System, and its hydropower potential was identified by various studies carried out by international agencies, with the first report issued by the Canadian Consultant group MONENCO in 1983, followed by a 1994 study by the German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ) that formally proposed the Karot Hydropower Project.[3]

On September 28, 2016, the federal and Azad Jammu and Kashmir governments signed an implementation agreement with a Chinese consortium for development and operation on river Jhelum at a levelised tariff of 7.57 cents per unit for 30 years. Financial close of the project was achieved in February 2017 while land acquisition award has also been done.

Groundbreaking on the project took place on January 10, 2016.[4] Construction works were 25% complete as of September 2017, and 70% as of January 2020.[2]

Project details [ edit ]

The major project features include construction of concrete gravity 95.5 meters high dam with a crest length of 320 meters near the village of Gohra.[5] The dam's reservoir will be approximately 164.5 million cubic meters in volume, with a length of 27 kilometers.[6][7] 72 homes and 58 businesses are expected to require relocation as a result of construction,[8] while 2.8 kilometers of the Karot-Kotli road, and 8.9 kilometers of the Azad Pattan-Kahuta road will need relocation.[9]

The power intake structure will be constructed on right bank of the river immediately upstream of Dam site and will divert the water into headrace tunnels entering into Cavern Powerhouse. The water will be discharged back to River Jhelum through tail-race channel located at right bank of the River Jhelum immediately downstream of Karot village. The dam will generate mean annual energy 3,436 GWh, and will connect to Pakistan's national electricity grid.

Financing [ edit ]

The Karot project is being developed by Karot Power Company comprising Three Gorges South Asia Investment Limited, a subsidiary of China Three Gorges Corporation, China-CTGC and Associated Technologies of Pakistan.

Total costs for the project are estimated to be $2 billion, and will be funded by International Finance Corporation, China's Silk Road Fund.[10] The Export-Import Bank of China and China Development Bank will issue loans to the Karot Power Company.[11] It will be built on a ""Build-Own-Operate-Transfer"" basis for 30 years, after which ownership will be turned over to the government of Pakistan.[12]

After completion, the company will run and maintain the project for 30 years at a levelised tariff of 7.57 cents per unit after which it will be transferred to the Punjab government at a notional price of Rs.1."	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karot_Hydropower_Project
Active	"The Government has assured timely completion of the Julius Nyerere Hydropower Project (JNHPP) that is expected to produce 2,115 megawatts of electricity, noting that the execution of the project is progressing well.

The project that is constructed along the Rufiji River, Coast Region, by a joint venture of Egyptian companies, Arab Contractors and El Sewedy Electric Co at a cost of 3.6 billion US dollars, (around 6.5tri/-) is scheduled to be completed in June 2020.

The Minister for Energy Dr Medard Kalemani who visited the site on Sunday said the government has already paid 1.19tri/- out of the total cost of the project.

He said, despite the ongoing rain across the country, the execution of the project has continued as planned, assuring that nothing has been affected.

""I would like to assure Tanzanians that the project will continue despite rain, and the government is determined to ensure that everything is completed by June 14, 2020 as per the signed contract,"" he said on his 11th tour to the project since its commencement.

According to him, the renovation of Tazara Railway at Fuga area which is located nearby the site has made easy transportation of equipment needed for the construction.

""The Fuga station plays a crucial role in the construction of this project, the work has become easier than if we were to use a road,"" noted the minister.

He also challenged the management of Tazara to continue cooperating with the Tanzania National Electricity Supply Company (Tanesco) and consultant of the project, the Tanroads Consulting Unit (TECU), on the best ways to maintain the line that is playing a great role in the project.

Dr Kalemani also asked the Tanzania National Roads Agency Tanroads to construct the 35.8 Kilometers length road that link Fuga station and JNHPP site at tarmac level, to ease the transportation of equipment dropped by train from Dar es Salaam.

""Tanroads should start construction of this road immediately. I have seen it by myself that it needs renovation,"" he noted expressing his satisfaction with all roads within the site.

Expounding, the minister reminded the contractor to adhere within all directives of the government by not importing equipment available in the country including cement and steel.

According to him recently the constructor was forced to return over 2,000 tonnes of steel that were bought outside the country.

""The speed of the project is satisfactory and this is because the majority of the labour force is Tanzanians who are 3,822 in total, making 64.8 per cent of the entire workforce at the site,"" he gratified.

Briefing the Minister, the Project supervisor Engineer Steven Manda said the execution of the project has been rung smoothly from the beginning in 2018.

""Tanzanians should be comfortable that the project will be completed on time as scheduled, the constructor is working well with the strategic plan,"" he assured.

For his part, the Managing Director of Tanesco Dr Tito Mwinuka commented on the competence of Tanzania engineers who have taken part in the project saying they are doing well.

""They are competent enough and they are learning a lot from their counterparts, in other projects there will be no need to invite foreigners, ours will be able to do it,"" he said."	https://africa-energy-portal.org/news/tanzania-govt-upbeat-nyerere-hydropower-project-completion

Going up along the Blue Nile near the border with Sudan, and under construction since 2011, the $4.5 billion dam – also known by its acronym GERD - will be Africa’s biggest hydroelectric power plant once completed.

Negotiations centre on the pace at which Ethiopia fills the 74 billion cubic metre reservoir behind the dam and the impact that could have on water supplies downstream in Sudan and Egypt.

Ethiopia is keen to start filling the reservoir in July.

“The Secretary-General underscores the importance of the 2015 Declaration of Principles on the GERD, which emphasizes cooperation based on common understanding, mutual benefit, good faith, win-win, and the principles of international law,” the spokesman said.

“The Secretary-General encourages progress towards an amicable agreement in accordance with the spirit of these Principles,” he added.

Resolving differences

Cairo, Addis Ababa and Khartoum have all indicated their willingness to resume discussions, but differences linger over the appropriate mechanism for such talks.

UN experts say that Egypt wants to put international pressure on Ethiopia to agree to a proposal - put forward by the United States and World Bank - on the dam’s first filling and annual operation.

But Ethiopia is rejecting that idea as severely limiting the dam’s capacity to generate electricity and curtailing rights to future upstream development, among other reasons.

Egypt also insists that Ethiopia must not start filling the reservoir until an agreement is reached, in line with its interpretation of the Declaration that Ethiopia is contesting.

The Secretary-General encourages progress towards an amicable agreement -- UN Spokesperson

The Declaration, signed in March 2015, outlines the parties’ commitment to cooperation and to resolve differences through negotiations. It also states that if a dispute cannot be resolved, the matter can be referred to the heads of State and Government with an option for a joint request for mediation.

Ethiopia favours resolving the dispute at the trilateral level and has historically been against internationalizing the issue, seeing no mediation role for the United Nations.

On 13 May, Sudan’s Ministry of Irrigation said that the country could not agree to an Ethiopian proposal on the initial filling as it failed to address longer-term technical, legal and environmental issues.

According to news reports, Egypt also dismissed the Ethiopian proposal on the initial filling, writing a letter to the Security Council on 1 May calling on Ethiopia to respect its obligations and resume talks."	https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/05/1064452

The mega flagship development power project which is financed 100 per cent by the government at a cost of 6.55tri/-, commenced in June last year and is set for completion in the next two years.

The 2,115 megawatts power project will be the fourth biggest dam in Africa and ninth in the world. Africa's largest dam is Ethiopia's Renaissance, which is under construction, with 6,450 megawatts expected upon completion in 2022.

The Mambira Dam in Nigeria follows second with 3,050 megawatts ahead of Ethiopian Shaika Dam that produces 2,160MW.

The Aswan Dam in Egypt, with 2,100 megawatts comes fifth in the ranking, beating Raula Dam in Angola, which produces 2,066 megawatts.

The Energy Minister Dr Medard Kalemani said recently that the government has already paid 1.19tri/- out of the total cost, which is 100 per cent of the amount stated in the contract for the initial period.

The Julius Nyerere Hydropower project is expected to transform the energy sector and guarantee the country with sufficient energy necessary for speeding up development of other economic sectors particularly the industrialisation drive.

The power project which is constructed by a joint venture of Egyptian companies, Arab Contractors and El Sewedy Electric Co is expected to double electricity generation.

Dr Kalemani told the parliament while tabling the 2020/21 budget estimates said the electricity generation rose to 1,601.84 megawatts as of April this year in comparison to 1,308 megawatts in 2015.

Works implemented during the 2019/20 since when it commenced in June last year are namely construction of the main dam, and the diversion tunnel with the projection of being completed in June 2022.

The Energy Minister said a total of 1.44tri/- has been set aside during 2020/21 fiscal year and works to be executed include the main dam and spillways), tunnels and power house as well switch yard.

A total of 3,897 people have been employed out of whom 3,422 are Tanzania, which is 87.81 per cent and 475 employees are foreigners equivalent to 12.19 per cent of all employees.

About 6,000 Tanzanians will be employed during the project implementation.

Electricity supply in Tanzania goes beyond household use for lighting homes, charging phones or powering household appliances such as radios and TVs but is intended to spur economic growth.

To grow Tanzania's economy requires productive use of energy to power local businesses, provide better health and education services and drive agriculture production.

Over the years the power sector of Tanzania has been dominated by hydropower and at the moment about 45 per cent of power generated comes from hydropower dam.

The sufficient electricity to be generated from the Julius Nyerere Dam is expected to save almost 400 hectares of trees felled annually for charcoal and firewood as well as unsustainable agricultural practices.

However, cutting down trees means that rain water cannot sink into the ground, hence, when it rains water goes straight to the rivers then into the ocean.

Tabling the budget speech for the 2020/21 fiscal year, the Finance and Planning Minister Dr Philip Mpango said the commencement of construction of an historic project of Julius Nyerere Hydropower (2,115 MW) at Rufiji River is one of the notable achievements in the implementation of energy infrastructure projects.

Construction of $2.58 billion Van Phong 1 coal-fired power project kicked off

On October 6, Sumitomo Corporation organised the ground-breaking ceremony of Van Phong 1 coal-fired power project after 12 years of waiting. Entailing the construction of a new supercritical coal-fired power plant with a generation capacity of 1,320MW (two 660MW power-generation units) in Van Phong Special Administrative-Economic Zone (SAEZ)in Vietnam’s Khanh Hoa province, Van Phong 1 is a build-operate-transfer (BOT) power generation project that will sell electricity to EVN (Vietnam’s state-owned power company) over a period of 25 years. Total project costs should reach about $2.58 billion and will generate 9 billion kWh per year.

The project was implemented in 2007, however, it was not until July 2017 that the Ministry of Planning and Investment granted the investment registration certificate for Sumitomo. In October 2018, the investor official signed the BOT contract and power selling contract with partners while simultaneously receiving government guarantee.

It has been 12 years since the investor expressed interest in the project and land clearance was finished in May 2019. At the ground-breaking ceremony, Nguyen Tan Tuan, chairman of the Khanh Hoa People’s Committee, said that the Van Phong 1 coal-fired power project is the largest industrial project in the province so far.

In this April, Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) signed a loan agreement for project finance (a financing scheme in which repayments for a loan are made solely from the cash flows generated by the project) amounting up to approximately $1.19 billion (JBIC’s portion) with Van Phong Power CO., Ltd., for the Van Phong 1 project.

The loan is co-financed with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, MUFG Bank, Mizuho Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation, and DBS Bank, and the Bank of China, with a total co-financing amount of approximately $1.99 billion. The co-financed portion will be covered by insurance from Nippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI).

Besides, in this August, Toshiba Energy Systems & Solutions Corporation (Toshiba ESS) announced that the four-party consortium of Toshiba ESS, IHI Corporation, CTCI Corporation, and Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction has won an EPC contract from Van Phong Power Co., Ltd. Accordingly, Toshiba ESS will be in charge of the design, manufacturing, installation, and test operation for the stream turbines and generators (STGs) used in the project.

According to EVN, Vietnam’s energy demand has risen sharply in line with its economic growth, and the power supply is getting tight especially in the southern region. To respond to the situation, the Vietnamese government aims to increase the country’s total power generation capacity from power plants to approximately 129,500MW in 2030, according to the Revised National Power Development Master Plan for the 2011-2020 period with vision to 2030 issued in 2016. Once built, the Van Phong 1 plant will increase power generation at an amount equivalent to about 3 per cent of the current total installed capacity of the country, equalling 48,573MW.

Active	"Is work finally underway on the Mambilla hydroelectric megaproject site? Nigeria’s Minister of Energy, Sale Mamman, said recently that an agreement had been reached on a dispute that is blocking the implementation of the Mambilla hydroelectric project in eastern Nigeria.

Sunrise Power and Transmission is behind this legal twist. The Nigerian company has filed a lawsuit against the Nigerian federal government before the Commercial Court in Paris. This legal action follows the cancellation in 2007 of its contract in favour of the Chinese companies Sinohydro and China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC). Sunrise Power is therefore claiming damages of USD 2.3 billion from the government.

Minister Sale Mamman said that Attorney General Abubakar Malami was in the process of finalising the terms of the agreement. A conclusion that leaves minister Sale Mamman optimistic.

The start of work in 2020

The implementation of the Mambilla hydroelectric megaproject will require an investment of $4.8 billion. The Federal Government of Nigeria will finance the project with a loan from Exim Bank of China. The state-owned Bank of China had been forced to delay the release of the funds due to the dispute between the government and Sunrise Power.

Sale Mamman says the case is almost closed and the project would enter the construction phase before the end of this year. The Mambilla Dam is expected to provide 3.05 GW of electricity and will be raised on the Dongo River at Gembu village, becoming one of the largest water reservoirs in West Africa. This huge infrastructure is expected to displace 100,000 people in Tabara State. A situation that has led several development partners to be reluctant to finance the project.

Technically, Sinohydro and CCECC will have to divert part of the water from the Mimballa Dam reservoir, which has been in place since 1982. The water will be channelled through three tunnels of 33 km each. Part of the water, which arrives with very high pressure, will be intercepted by the Sum and Nghu dams. The other part of the water from the Mambilla dam will feed the two underground power stations built in the rock. The largest dam will be 150 m high.

ISLAMABAD: The Diamer-Bhasha Dam contactors have started mobilising to the project site and its construction will start soon, the participants of a meeting held at the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) Complex were informed on Wednesday.



Federal Water Resources Minister Faisal Vawda presided over the meeting to review the implementation plan of the project. The other participants included Wapda Chairman Lt Gen (retd) Muzammil Hussain, member (water) and project general manager Amir Bashir Chaudhry, consultants and contractors .



Vawda expressed his satisfaction over the pace of the project despite the Covid-19 pandemic slowing down routine activities.



The minister noted that following the signing of the project’s contract last month, work was continuing at a good pace that reflected the government’s commitment to the construction of mega dams to avert the looming water crisis in the country and add low-cost hydel electricity to the national grid.



The minister directed the consultants and contractors to adhere to the timelines specified in the plan so that the project could be completed in time.



The Wapda chairman, dilating upon the construction schedule, briefed about the major milestones of the implementation plan.

He added that the work on the infrastructure development in the project area was being carried out at a good pace.



The chairman said Wapda was committed to completing the dam in accordance with the stipulated time frame.



The dam will not only help generate low-cost hydel electricity for the economic development of the country, but also provide water to the agricultural sector and mitigate floods.



The project has a gross storage capacity of 8.1million acre feet (MAF) and power generation capacity of 4,500 megawatt (MW), with an annual generation of 18.1 billion units per annum. The construction of the project will enhance life of Tarbela Dam by 35 years.



Last month, an agreement worth Rs442 billion with a joint venture of Power China and Frontier Works Organisation (FWO) was signed on Wednesday for the construction of the Diamer-Bhasha Dam.



It included a diversion system, the main dam, an access bridge and a 21-megawatt Tangir hydroelectric power project.



Wapda has already awarded the contract for consultancy services for the Diamer-Bhasha dam worth Rs27.182 billion to Diamer-Bhasha Consultants Group (DBCG). The consultancy agreement includes construction design, construction supervision and contract administration for the project. The DBCG joint venture comprises 12 top-ranked national and foreign consulting firms."	https://tribune.com.pk/story/2249779/1-contractors-moving-diamer-bhasha-dam-site

PESHAWAR - The Khyber Pakthunkhwa Government has completed 255 mini macro hydro-power projects and work on 67 others were in full swing in 12 northern districts of the province to provide inexpensive electricity to people as per vision of Prime Minister Imran Khan.

The KP government has also proposed seven mega projects for inclusion in CPEC include Mujigram-Shghor 64MW, Istaru Booni 72MA, Turen More Kari 350MW, Jamshill Turen More 260MW, Ghrait-Swir Lasht 277MW, Torcamp-Guddubar 409MW, Kari-Mushkur 446MW and power evacuation from Chitral to Chakdar through a transmission line that after completion would help arrest energy and water problems. The Government has signed MoU with Chinese companies for construction of these seven gigantic hydropower projects of 1978 MW proposed under CPEC in Chitral, officials in KP energy department told APP. Till August 2018, the official said KP government with help of NGOs has completed 255 out of 356 mini macro hydropower projects (MMHPPs) in 12 northern districts of the province whereas work on 67 others were in full swing.

As per contract of 356 MMHPPs, the feasibility studies of 333 have been approved by the competent forum out of which 255MMHPPs with 13445 kilowatts power generation capacity has been completed. Out of 255 MMHPPs, 15 were completed in Abbottabad, 51 Batagram, 44 Chitral, 40 Swat, 28 Kohistan, 21 Shangla, 37 Upper Dir, four Lower Dir, 13 Buner and one each in Torghar and Manshera districts.

As many as seven MMHPPs are being constructed in Batagram, 11 in Chitral, five in Swat, seven in Kohistan, three Shangla, 12 Upper Dir, five Buner, two Lower Dir and nine in Manshera with help of NGOs. The official said litigants and shifting of heavy machinery to mountainous areas besides others factors contributed to delay in construction of remaining MMHPPs. “The electricity transmission from most of these MMHPPs had already been started to communities living near it with a significant positive socio-economic changes are being witnessed in their lifestyle,” the official said.

The KP government is taking a lead role by capitalizing on an excellent work made by previous PTI government to complete ongoing dams and hydropower projects on different rivers and tributaries on war footing basis to provide affordable energy and clean drinking water under Prime Minister Imran Khan’s vision to all.

KP government accelerated work on five ongoing small medium and big hydropower projects (HPP) with overall 215.8megawatt (MW) capacity costing Rs64980.1million, which would be completed by May 2019, officials in KP Energy Department told APP.

These projects include 10.8MW Jabori Manshera HPP costing Rs3798.26million with completion of 70pc work whereas on Karora HPP in Shangla with 11.2MW capacity costing Rs4620.06 million, 65pc work was completed. At least 30pc work on Koto HPP Dir Lower with 40.8MW costing Rs14252.84 million, 25pc work on 84MW Matiltan HPP Swat worth Rs20722.94 million and 30pc work on 69MW Lawi HPP costing Rs21586m were completed by previous PTI government.

“We have offered seven sites of 668MW to private sector for investment and response of investors are highly encouraging,” the official said, adding Sharmai HPP with 150MW capacity, has been awarded to a company while six others projects namely Nardam Dam in Manshera 188MW, Shigokach HPP in Lower Dir 102MW, Arkari Gol HPP CHitral 99MW, Batakundi HPP in Manshera 96MW and Nandihar HPP Batagram would be awarded soon.

These gigantic projects would be completed with USD 1435 million, which would provide inexpensive electricity and uninterrupted water supply to people and agriculture besides giving enormous boost to business, industrial and infant industries. Three mega hydropower power projects of 506MW capacity including Shushgai-Zhendoli 144MW, Shogo-Sin 132MW and Laspur Marigram 230MA in Chitral have been awarded to FWO to ensure its speedy construction.

The official said negotiations were underway with Asian Development Bank (ADB) for construction of Balakot Manshera project of 300MW capacity. CWDP has approved concept papers of Barikot Patrak HPP in Lower Dir with 47MW capacity, Patrak Shangrail HPP Lower Dir with 22 MW and Gabral Kalam Swat 110 MW for which negotiations was held with World Bank for its construction.

Under development of mini-macro hydropower sites initiative , the Energy Department has identified 160 hydropower sites on canals costing Rs3301mln and 512 hydropower sites on rivers and tributaries costing Rs8495.41mln to fully tap KP’s hydel generation and water potential.

The official said consultants were hired for these mega projects after it was approved by PDWP on November 11, 2017. To save energy, KP Govt has started focus on solarization of schools and basic health units and decided to solarize 8000 schools including 30pc girls schools and 187BHUs with an estimated cost of Rs4347m for which services of consultant was hired.

The KP government has also decided to solarize 100 villages in southern and central districts of the province and under this mega project, 2900 solar system has been provided to people of these districts. “We have started implementation on this key project costing Rs300mln under which each household will get 30watts solar panel, three LED lights, one each ceiling and pedestal fan, one mobile phone charging slot and two batteries,” the official elaborated.

The KP Govt has completed survey and hiring of consultant to solarize 4440 mosques in the province besides solarization of remaining blocks of Civil Secretariat and Chief Minister Secretariat, Peshawar.

PTI MNA Nasir Khan Musazai told APP that completion scores of water, energy and hydropower projects during tenure of previous PTI Govt was a clear manifestation of fulfillment of the promises made by PTI leadership with people.

“Our political opponents and critics had started baseless criticism on PTI when Imran Khan announced construction of 356 min-micro power stations in KP while addressing a public meeting in Swat in 2014,” he said, adding successful construction of 255MMHPPs has proved all criticism and slogans of political opponents as wrong today.

“Prime Minister Imran Khan is the last hope for people of Pakistan and under his dynamic leadership, all the inherited problems including shortage of energy and water would be resolved,” he maintained.

Musazai urged people of all walk of life especially land owners, traders, and industrialists and expatriates Pakistanis to donate generously in the joint fund of PM-CJP for construction of Diamir Bhasha and Mohmand dams and play constructive role in progress and development of the country."	https://nation.com.pk/01-Oct-2018/kp-govt-completes-255-mini-hydropower-projects

PESHAWAR - Water and Power Develop­ment Authority (Wapda) Chairperson Muzammil Hus­sain has said the first unit of the Mohmand Dam will start operation by December 2025.”

After the Tarbela Dam, the Mohmand Dam is expected to be the next big water pro­ject in the country and is be­ing constructed day and night, he said.

The Mohmand Dam was the fifth highest concrete-face rock-fill dam in the world, the chairperson said while ad­dressing media at the dam site. “Although it started late, con­struction of the dam will be very fruitful for Pakistan.”

The dam is expected to pro­duce 800 megawatts of elec­tricity and will enable the storage of 1.3 million acre-feet of water. “From 2020 to 2028 almost 2,900 megawatts of electricity produced will be both cheap and green [envi­ronmental friendly],” Hussain said.

The dam site is located in the Mohmand district of Khy­ber Pakhtunkhwa. Residents of the district are equally excited at the construction of the dam as they believe it will improve their standard of living.

“It will make our lands fertile and refill streams leading to the fields,” a resident said. “The dam’s construction will also bring education and employ­ment for our people,” he added.

Dam is expected to produce 800MW of electricity enabling storage of 1.3mcf of water.

The Wapda chairperson add­ed that Rs309 billion was be­ing spent on the construction, which has been paid by the au­thority and through foreign funding.

ISLAMABAD - To meet electricity requirements of the Diamer Bhasha Hydro Project (DBHP) during construction, the government is planning to construct 15 MW Tangir Hydropower Project in Gilgit Baltistan which will increase the cost of the project by Rs6 billion.

The proposal will be submitted to the upcoming elected government and if they approved it the cost of Diamer Bhasha Dam component will increase from the ECNEC approved cost of Rs474 billion to Rs480 billion, official source told The Nation here Tuesday.

According the official documents earlier it was decided that the position paper regarding inclusion of 15 MW Tangir Hydropower Project into Diamer Bhasha Dam Project will be processed by the Ministry of Water Resources.

However Ministry of Water Resources verbally requested that Ministry of PD&R may process it through CDWP/ECNEC.

The proposal to construct Tangir Hydropower Project will increase the cost of Diamer Bhasha Dam Project from Rs474 billion to Rs480 billion.

The project will be completed in June 2027 and the cost will be shared by the Federal government, Wapda equity and commercial borrowing.

The Federal government will provide Rs 234 billion (49 percent) through PSDP, Wapda equity Rs100 billion (21percent) and Commercial Borrowing Rs146 billion (30percent).

As per the detail the project was considered by the ECNEC in its meeting held on 17th April, 2018 and instead of PC-I cost of Rs649 billion approved the project at a rationalized cost of Rs474 billion including FEC of Rs154 billion.

While talking to media persons Li Yuanling, Counsellor Embassy of China said that being at an advanced stage of development Suki Kinari Hydropower Project (SKHPP) has been included in the strategic China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).

He said the project is listed as the high priority ‘Early Harvest Project (EHP)’ within the CPEC projects. Due to its importance, this project is being supported and closely monitored by the governments of Pakistan and China.

Suki Kinari Hydropower project is located on Kunhar River in the Kaghan Valley of District Mansehra, Khyber Pakhtunkwa.

Briefing about the project the Chinese engineer said that Chinese company ‘China Gezgouba Group Corporation’ started working on Suki Kinari Hydropower Project in December 2016 with the estimated cost of US $1.9 billion. The project would be completed on 31 December 2022 in 6 years.

Chinese engineer said in addition to our project, two projects have been announced by KPK at Batakundi (96MW) and Naran (188MW) both upstream of our project. Another project Patrind (147MW) is already underway downstream. So in all there would be 4 projects on this river with total capacity of 1300MW. Share of SK Hydro is 870MW. KPK is planning to undertake the Balakot Project (190MW) itself.

The Chinese engineer said that the Run-of-the-river projects envisage that the water is drawn from the river, taken to the turbines in a Powerhouse located downstream through tunnel and after running the turbines and producing energy the water is again diverted back to the river.

This water is now again available to be used to produce energy through yet another similar set up downstream. This is called cascading.

Chinese engineer said that the 3.081 billion MW of annual power will be generated during the formal operation of SKHPP. It helps alleviate Pakistan's chronic energy shortages, optimise power consumption structure and promote the economical development.

He said that cement, reinforcement, aggregate, diesel, explosive etc. are strongly required by the construction of SKHPP, which are purchased from Pakistan market.

He further said that the demand of Cement: 383000 tone with the amount of Rs4.6 billion; purchased quantities of cement: 22000 tone with the amount of Rs264 million.

The demand of reinforcement: 41280 tone with the amount of Rs4.3 billion; purchased quantities of reinforcement: 2900 tone with the amount of Rs302 million.

The demand of diesel: 29.8 billion liter with the amount of Rs3.4 billion; purchased quantities of diesel: the amount of Rs385 million. The demand of explosive: 3723 tone with the amount of Rs1.5 billion; purchased quantities of explosive: the amount of Rs90 million.

Chinese engineer said that around 1600 Pakistani people work in SKHPP including over 900 skilled people and over 700 labours. Recruitment plan in 2019 and 2020 will provide another 3000 jobs for the locals.

He said the majority of local people have not experience to work in Hydropower Project or other engineering projects, those of which need be trained by Chinese Foreman or skilled man such as surveyor, operator for heavy equipment, carpenter, electrician, welder, plumber etc.

The potential for energy generation from Kunhar River was first identified around 1960. In 1959, US consultants were engaged by Wapda to study this potential. In January 1960, they issued a report entitled “Kunhar River Project-Kaghan Valley.”"	https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/362437-suki-kinari-hydropower-project-to-produce-870mw
Active	"PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has intensified work on hydropower generation and spent a record Rs10.11 billion on six projects having the capacity of 252.4 megawatts (MW).

The provincial government through its Pakhtunkhwa Energy and Power Organisation (Pedo) is currently working on eight projects for producing 270 MW out of which projects of 56 MW were started by the previous ANP-PPP coalition government and 214 MW by the current Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI)-led government.

At least two of these projects, along with the much-trumpeted mini micro project of the present government, are going to be completed in the first and second quarter of the next year.

Apart from its ambitious mini micro hydel projects, the PTI government in recent months expedited work on six major projects to counter the assertion of its political opponents that it has failed to produce a single megawatt of power in the province.

The intensified utilisation of funds on the development of the hydropower generation projects is also apparently aimed at countering the claims of PTI’s rivals that the provincial government had no capacity to utilise funds even on the most vital power projects.

During its first financial year 2012-13, the government spent Rs1.8 billion on these projects.

In 2013-14 the utilisation of funds on the hydropower projects remained Rs4.0 billion and went up to Rs5.33 billion in 2014-15.

In the financial year 2015-16, the government could utilise only Rs3.77 billion of the development allocations that it had set aside for the power projects. Till 2015-16 fiscal the hydropower generation projects used to receive funds from the Annual Development Programme (ADP) of the province.

However, during the last fiscal of 2016-17, the provincial government allowed the Pedo to utilise the Hydel Development Fund (HDF) on the development of the ongoing as well as new hydropower generation projects in the province.

The HDF was established for the funds being received from the power sale proceeds and the outstanding arrears payable to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa by the federal government’s Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) on account of its share in the net hydel profits. The fund is exclusively spent on the development of the hydropower generation projects.

According to the documents of the hydropower projects development sector, the Pedo besides its HDF allocations had also spent Rs75 million of the Asian Development Bank loan.

Its total spending was Rs10.192 billion during the last fiscal. It included Rs2.702 billion which was spent on the construction of the Koto Hydropower Project.

The total cost of the project is Rs14 billion and it would be completed in the first quarter of 2019 to produce 40.8 MW electricity.

Also, Pedo is spending Rs1.828 billion on the Daral Khwar project having capacity of 36.6 MW. It is expected to be completed in the last quarter of the current year.

The provincial government is going to spend Rs1.44 million on the Mataltan hydro-power project. The project to produce 84 MW will be competed in 2021.

The government through Pedo is also spending Rs1.43 billion on the Lawi project with capacity of 69 MW. It is scheduled to be completed in 2021.

The provincial government during the last fiscal also spent Rs988 million on the mini micro projects. Its development expenditure on the Karora project of 11.8 MW and the Jabori project of 10.2 MW would be Rs1.73 billion. Both the projects are scheduled to be completed in the 4th quarter of the next calendar year."	https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/225650-KP-spends-Rs10b-on-252MW-hydropower-generation-projects

Dear Editor,

South Asian countries including Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka fall short of their electricity requirement and are faced with energy crisis (Ahmed 2015). This very specific region is bestowed with widespread large water bodies; therefore, hydro-electric power projects have been initiated on a very wide scale to cover up the shortage of electricity. Of these, Pakistan is an under-developing country, swiftly stabilizing its economy, and has been listed as one of the fastest growing economies in Asia. Pakistan has initiated hydropower projects on a very large scale, enrolling it among top 5 countries of the world investing that much in private participation infrastructure (Chaudhry 2017). The provincial governments have initiated hydropower projects in different parts of the country as well, such as the government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has initiated hydropower projects on quite a huge scale, more specifically in the northern and northwestern part of the province. In a long run, these projects will be definitely beneficial for the local masses by providing them cheaper and readily available electricity but at the cost of some unrecoverable environmental losses and miseries, wildlife biodiversity loss being the most prominent. These projects have been initiated without considering its impacts on local wildlife fauna, although the negative impacts of the effluents/discharge and thermal/hydro-peaking are as evident as bright daylight (Shi et al. 2015; Bai et al. 2017; Hesthagen et al. 2017; Negi and Punetha 2017; Wang et al. 2018). As revealed by recent studies regarding the ill effects of the hydropower projects on wildlife fauna and more specifically on aquatic animals, these projects will compensate electricity shortage at the cost of environmental degradation, biodiversity loss, and habitat loss of different aquatic animals including fish and macro-invertebrates (Schülting et al. 2016). The indigenous aquatic fauna of the area is therefore under severe threat of extinction and needs to be conserved on a priority basis.

Koto hydropower project is one of these projects (under-construction at district Lower Dir), which will produce > 40-MW electricity and will generate approximately Rs. 1970 Million (about $18.7) annually (TmgDir 2015) (Fig. 1 shows the satellite image of the project at/around Koto). The effluents and wastes from the project such as the disposals from the two exit tunnels (> 272 m) are dispatched directly into the main river of the district, the river Panjkora, home to a very diverse community of fish. In our recent research on the effects of the project on the level of heavy metals in the water, sediments, bioaccumulation in fish tissues, and ichthyofaunal diversity, it was observed that the level of heavy metals got increased drastically and the fish diversity declined extensively. Previously, 25 fish species were reported at Lower Dir district and 11 fish species at Upper Dir district from the river Panjkora (Muhammad et al. 2014; Hasan et al. 2015). Tragically, our present study found 15 fish species from the river only, although the study duration and total fish catch were higher than those of the previous studies. The construction and effluents from the said hydropower project resulted in a very drastic decrease in the fish fauna in the river Panjkora in just slightly over two years (started since February 2nd, 2015) (TmgDir 2015). Table 1 shows a comparison of the current study (after the construction of the dam) with the study of Hasan et al. (2015) conducted in 2012 (before the construction of the dam). Fig. 1 Satellite image of the Koto hydropower project Full size image Table 1 A comparison of the fish fauna of the river Panjkora before and after the construction of the Koto hydropower project at district Lower Dir (effluent discharge sites) Full size table

The hostile effects of the project on the environment and wildlife/biodiversity were overlooked while initiating it. Currently, there is no risk assessment, environmental monitoring, and environmental health and safety appraisal in the region by the local/provincial government or environmental protection agencies. Therefore, a specific team/environmental protection group should be recruited to look deep into the pros and cons of the hydropower projects in the region, and present an accurate comprehensive report on the hostile effects of the projects. However, it will be very difficult to compare the effects of the project as there is very fewer data available on the biodiversity/wildlife of the region. The key challenges to design and implement environmental measures were/are overlooking the hostilities of the project on wildlife, ignoring associated environmental concerns/issues, and less or no interest of the stakeholders in the environment.

The most economically valuable fish in the river including Cyprinion watsoni, Ctenopharyngodon idella, and Tor macrolepis were missing in effluent discharge sites as well as downstream, which affects more than 50 families dependent on the river for their living. The other missing fish species were Triplophysa microps, Schistura macrolepis, Schistura alepidota, Schistura prashari, Triplophysa naziri, Glyptothorax sufii, and Glyptothorax naziri. The number of Schizothorax plagiostomus, Schizopyge esocinus, Racoma labiata, Crossocheilus diplocheilus, and Garra gotyla was observed to be on decline alarmingly. The diversity indices of the river got decreased substantially as compared to the study of Ullah (2013). Moreover, over 300 of the collected fish specimens were hemorrhagic, colorless, scaleless, or attacked by a secondary infection such as saprolegniasis, because of being rendered vulnerable after exposure to the elevated level of heavy metals in the river.

Despite these critical conditions of the fish fauna in the river Panjkora and other rivers in the northwestern province of Pakistan, no proper attention is being paid to the conservation of the aquatic animals. The riverine coasts are being used for dumping of wastes from homes, hotels, and markets all along for more than two decades (Ullah et al. 2016). Now, the scenario has been worsened by the effluents/disposals/discharge/wastes from these projects, leading to the extermination of different fish species in these water bodies, some highly prized game fish species. The fisheries and wildlife departments have been inactive for very long. Therefore, before the extinction of other fish species in the river, immediate mitigating actions are required.

The abovementioned study is a single case, and many such cases are still unexplored around Pakistan and other South Asian countries. Keeping in view the current study and deleterious effects of the poorly managed hydropower projects (on the water quality of the river, fish diversity, and bioaccumulation of heavy metals at a threatening rate in the tissues of the highly prized game fish), it is proposed that the governmental/local/provincial funding bodies/organizations should impose developers to comply with the international state-of-the-art environment and safety rules, similar to the rules of the international financial institutions (i.e., world bank, AFB, etc.), even if no such international funds are directly attached to the project.

To mitigate the current scenario, it is suggested that the fisheries departments/organizations should stock fish in an appropriate amount and assess fish diversity and water quality at regular intervals to avoid further deterioration and diversity loss. The wildlife departments/organizations should ensure the safety and conservation of wild fauna at any cost. Strict environmental protection and fishing laws should be implemented. As a remedy to the current scenario, the nearby approachable water bodies having no or comparatively less stress may be used for stocking and conservation of the fish fauna, to ease migration of fish among these water bodies (Ullah et al. 2018). Furthermore, the hydraulic stress (thermal and hydro-peaking) after completion of the projects should be planned in a proper way to avoid further biodiversity loss. Safety to biodiversity and animal conservation should be prioritized by the local, provincial, and central governments before initiating hydropower projects; otherwise, the coming generations might not see the amazing animals’ diversity in the local hydrosphere in South Asian countries, which is the real beauty of nature. Keeping in view the current scenario, the slogan should be “biodiversity and animal conservation, we do care.”

To harness electricity from cleaner, renewable energy sources, the project is being setup with a cost of $55.59 million and is expected to achieve the financial close by June 2018 with expected commissioning in March 2021.

Currently, there is not a single run-of-the-river hydropower plant in operation in the province. Numerous sites have been identified for establishing small, mini and micro power stations on various perennial canals, lakes and falls, it said.

Sukkur Barrage is used to control water flow in the River Indus for the purposes of irrigation and flood control.

The barrage controls the flow to a major network of canals on both the banks of the Indus. The largest of the left bank canals are the Rohri and the Nara canals.

The project intends to exploit the power potential of the irrigation system, which supply demand areas downstream from the left bank of the River Indus.

Pakistan is one of those countries of the world that are blessed with huge hydropower potential. The geographic layout of the country, the natural water flow systems and irrigation system in the country manifest hydropower potential that can be harnessed to meet increasing energy needs of the country, it added.

Besides large hydro, there are definite prospects of development of small-mini-micro hydropower. Small hydropower is considered as one of the lucrative options for electricity generation.

According to Alternate Energy Development Board (AEDB), at present 128MW

is operational in the country, 877MW is under implementation and around 1,500MW is available for development."	https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/311387-sindh-s-first-run-of-the-river-power-plant-seeks-generation-licence

When completed, the 720-megawatt project that commenced construction in 2015 would annually produce some 3.2 billion kilowatt-hours of clean power, equivalent to 10pc of Pakistan’s total energy output from hydropower stations in 2017, said the report.

Being the first investment project of the Silk Road Fund, the hydropower project will pay $23 million in taxes to the Pakistani government and provide more than 2,200 jobs for locals during peak construction period, it added."	https://profit.pakistantoday.com.pk/2019/05/08/chinese-firm-to-complete-pakistan-hydropower-project-by-april-2021/
Active	"Globally, hydropower is recognized as renewable, cheap and reliable resource of energy. It generates electricity with zero emission and produces no waste. There is no requirement of fuel, operating cost is much lower and hydropower stations have longer lives than thermal power plants.

To resolve the power crisis in long term and to sustain economic growth, the optimal development of hydropower in the country is essentially needed. In fact, the development of hydropower is considered a key factor for future progress. Fortunately, enormous potential exists to exploit this unlimited indigenous resource of energy.

The installed capacity of hydropower plants owned and operated by the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) is around 9,538-MW. There are 21 power stations--- large, medium and small. In the year 2019, these power stations achieved the highest-ever electricity generation, having delivered 34.678 billion units (kWh) of energy to the national grid, despite various technical constraints.

Currently, WAPDA is implementing a number of multi-purpose mega and medium water and power projects. These include hydropower generating facilities, either reservoir-based or run-of-the-river type. It has recently embarked upon a series of new hydropower projects. Keyal Khwar Hydropower (128-MW), Mohmand Dam (800-MW), Dasu Hydropower, stage-1 (2,160-MW) are under construction, whereas Diamer Basha Dam (4,500-MW), Bunji Dam (7,100-MW), Harpo Hydropower (34.5-MW), Kurram Tangi Dam, stage-1 (18.9-MW) and Tarbela 5th Extension (1,410-MW) are at advanced stages of kick-start for construction.

On the other hand, WAPDA has set as a strategic priority to carry out major renovation, refurbishing, upgrading and modernization of its existing old hydropower plants, aiming to harness optimal hydropower potential at the sites. Rehabilitation and refurbishment of Mangla power station is being implemented since 2016 though the project is far behind the schedule for completion. Now, stage is set for the construction of Warsak Rehabilitation-II project. Likewise, major repair, overhaul and rehabilitation of Tarbela power station Units 1-14 is being carried under a phased program. All these projects are being financed by the international donor agencies.

WAPDA operates a number of small hydropower stations, with cumulative capacity of over 87-MW, connected to national grid. These are Jabban (22-MW), Rasul (22-MW), Dargai (20-MW), Gomal Zam (17.4-MW), Nandipur (13.8-MW), Shadiwal (13.5-MW), Chichoki Mallian (13.2-MW), Kurram Garhi (4-MW), Renala (1.1-MW) and Chitral hydel power station (1-MW). While their share in total installed hydropower capacity at WAPDA system is just one per cent, these small hydropower stations contribute significantly towards bridging the gap of electricity demand and supply, thus reducing load-shedding, particularly during peak hours. Being connected to the national grid, these small powerhouses not only benefit the region but the entire national economy.

The economic lifetime of a hydropower plant is around 50 years, depending on operating conditions of the installed plant machinery that however needs regular maintenance, periodic overhauls and partial replacement & upgradation of equipment.

However, most of these small power stations were commissioned more than half a century ago, and have not been upgraded or refurbished since then. Therefore, these powerhouses have outlived their designed useful life since long, resulting in loss of power generation.

Nonetheless, despite their being obsolesce and operating much below their rated capacity, these small power stations generate over 300 million of units (kWh) of low-cost electricity each year. The reliability of existing electro-mechanical equipment of these powerhouses has deteriorated, and efficiency reduced from designed values and parameters of the installed equipment. To achieve high availability and reliability of operations of these old power stations, it is essential to undertake major overhaul, rehabilitation, upgrading and replacement of existing hydro-mechanical and electrical equipment. This will also result in enhancing capacity, in a few cases, and increasing profitability and long-term value of these hydropower stations—for another 30-40 years.

Modernization of these old powerhouses is required for achieving higher performance as well as for safety improvements according to international standards. WAPDA has on cards the refurbishment of its small hydropower stations since long, but due to paucity of funds and lack of interest by the government, most of these schemes could not see light of the day. On the other hand, WAPDA priority remained the completion of on-going and launching new mega projects for political gains. The first and only project implemented so far is the refurbishment of Jabban hydropower station located in Malakand District in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa that was installed sometime in 1938.

Reconstruction of the powerhouse, which was de-commissioned in 2006 as a result of a fire accident, started in February 2010. Complete power plant machinery was replaced, utilizing the existing infrastructure of transmission and dispersal of power. Four modern turbines of 5.5-MW each and allied electro-mechanical equipment have been installed, making the up-rated installed capacity to 22-MW against original 19.6-MW. The new power plant is in operation since 2014.

Meanwhile, WAPDA has finalized its program for launching refurbishment of another three small hydropower stations----Dargai, Chitral and Renala. The Dargai (Malakand-II) power station, located on Swat River, has four units of 5-MW each, and was commissioned during 1951-52. The power station is in operation and generates about 90 million kWh for national grid. It is proposed to replace all the electromechanical equipment including turbines, generators, transformers and switchyard equipment etc., which will also enhance the powerhouse capacity to 22-MW.

PC-1 of the project Rehabilitation of Dargai Hydroelectric Power Station was approved by the ECNEC (Executive Committee of the National Economic Council) in November 2018 at a cost of four billion rupees. Implementation period is estimated to be 71 months. Foreign currency portion of the project amounting to Euro 35 million is to be financed by the French Development Agency (AFD). Appointment of the Consultants is in advanced stage.

Currently, WAPDA is in the process of hiring consultants for Capacity Enhancement Project of Chitral Hydel Power station from the existing 1-MW to 5-MW. Chitral powerhouse was completed in two phases in 1975 and 1982. AFD has committed to finance the project under soft loan program.

Renala hydropower — the oldest power station in the country — was commissioned in March 1925. Located on Lower Bari Doab Canal, in Okara District, it has five turbo-generators of total 1.1-MW capacity, and all its units have been in operation since then. After rehabilitation and refurbishment, there is a potential to enhance the power station’s capacity up to 4.4-MW, utilizing full available water discharge. In fact, the existing 1.1-MW powerhouse will be maintained after rehabilitation, and a new power plant of 4.4-MW will be constructed at site.

On completion, the powerhouse will generate 25.6 GwH annually, almost four times its existing power generation. The up-rated project will also involve remodeling of existing power channel off-taking from the canal, and the construction of new spillways. For the purpose, additional land acquisition from the Government of Punjab is in process. The project’s feasibility has been finalized by WAPDA, PC-1 is approved, and financing arrangement is in hand. Total cost of the project is estimated at $16.2 million.

WAPDA also has plans to modernize and rehabilitate the 3.5-MW Kurram Garhi hydel power station which is located on Kuchkot Canal in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and was constructed in 1958. On completion of the project, the power house capacity will be enhanced to 5-MW, capable of generating 37 GWh energy. Consultants for detailed engineering & design and construction supervision are to be appointed shortly.

LAHORE - The Pakistan Industrial and Traders Associations Front (PIAF) chairman Mian Nauman Kabir has welcomed the start of construction work of 4,500MW Diamer Bhasha Dam, after witnessing four inaugurations by four prime ministers in four decades, as the dam first envisaged in 1980, hoping that the Pakistan’s biggest dam won’t be delayed now and would be completed in its stipulated time period.

“Its unfortunate that the world’s highest roller compacted concrete dam has seen four openings by four elected prime ministers, including PM Shaukat Aziz, PM Yousaf Raza Gilani, PM Nawaz Sharif and now PM Imran Khan, taking more than 40 years to finally kicking off its construction,” he said.

In a joint statement with senior vice chairman Nasir Hameed and vice chairman Javed Iqbal, he said that the dam first envisaged in 1980 was approved for construction in 2006 by the then military ruler Pervez Musharraf who had said: “Water and energy are matters of life and death for us. We have to build all dams”. But it took almost another 14 years to initiate construction work after its first construction approval.

Mian Nauman suggested the government to also include more hydropower projects in its plan including Kalabagh Dam, as the country could not afford to rely on costly and anti-environment fossil fuels.

Its unfortunate that world’s highest roller compacted concrete dam has seen four openings by four elected prime ministers

“PIAF is hopeful that the hydel power project, which would generate 4,500 MW of affordable, clean energy, boosting local industry and also creating more than 16,000 jobs in the country, would be completed within its time frame in 2028 and would not be delayed like several other hydro power projects in the country,” he stated.

It’s a good news for the public in general and business community in particular, as the new project would enable the country to move towards cheaper and greener power, inviting investment of billions of dollars, besides generating local job opportunities, he added.

Mian Nauman Kabir emphasized the importance of dams, stating that over 20 million acres of barren land could be brought under cultivation if the water was made available by developing water storages in the country. Senior vice chairman Nasir Hameed said that with construction of dams, the country could strengthen its agriculture to attain food security and cope with the fast growing needs of water in domestic and industrial sectors besides injecting sizeable low-cost hydroelectricity into the national grid to stabilize the national economy.

Nasir Hameed said that the dam’s 6.4 million-acre feet of water would irrigate at least 1.2 million acres of the agricultural area. Diamer Bhasha dam would increase the country’s storage capacity from 30 to 48 days.

He called for speedy work of other power projects including Shargthang, Hanzal, Chilas, Naltar and Hassanabad Hunza, besides early construction of Kalabagh Dam which was the most suitable project for the national economy as it would produce cheap and sufficient electricity.

Vice Chairman Javed Siddiqi said that Kalabagh dam should not be ignored at any cost, as water scarcity was heading towards the point of no return.

Javed Siddiqi maintained that hydropower was the most advanced and mature renewable energy technology and provided some level of electricity generation in more than 160 countries worldwide. Moreover, hydropower is an attractive renewable option given the low-cost of electricity it produces, low greenhouse gas emissions and the flexibility it provides to the grid.

He said that Pakistan had to develop mega and small dams to store water if it wanted to avert water crisis in the coming years.

PIAF appreciates that despite prevailing situation of COVID-19 in the country, the mega project of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is being moved forward with full force and hope that more projects under CPEC would be signed in future.

The government should be lauded for focusing on clean energy to mitigate the climate change impact, as the dual benefits of generating electricity from water instead of furnace oil or coal would save the country billions of dollars spent on importing fuel while reducing the negative impact on the environment."	https://nation.com.pk/19-Jul-2020/piaf-hails-construction-of-diamer-bhasha-dam

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Wednesday kicked off construction work at the Diamer-Bhasha dam in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, notwithstanding India's objection to the China-backed mega project.

Addressing a public gathering in Chilas in Gilgit-Baltistan, Khan said the Diamer-Bhasha will be Pakistan's third largest dam after Tarbela and Mangla dams.

The project will generate 4,500MW electricity and provide at least 16,000 jobs.

It is expected to be completed by 2028.

The Pakistan government in May signed a whopping Rs 442 billion contract with a joint venture of a Chinese state-run firm and a commercial arm of Pakistan's powerful military for the construction of the Diamer-Bhasha dam.

Chinese state-run firm China Power holds 70% and the Frontier Works Organisation (FWO), a commercial arm of the Armed Forces of Pakistan, 30% share in the consortium that will build the dam.

In May, India took strong note of Pakistan awarding the contract to build the dam, saying carrying out of such projects in territories under Pakistan's illegal occupation was not proper.

""Our position is consistent and clear that entire territory of the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh have been, are and will continue to be integral and inalienable part of India,"" MEA Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said.

""We have consistently conveyed our protests and shared concerns with both Pakistan and China on all such projects in the Indian territories under Pakistan's illegal occupation,"" he said.

Pakistan's Council of Common Interests (CCI) approved the project for construction in 2010, but it suffered delays because of international lending agencies which remained associated with the project but later backtracked because of opposition from India as major part of the dam is located in Gilgit-Baltistan.

In his address, Khan lamented that building of this dam was delayed while the previous governments started building thermal power stations.

""The decision to build this dam was taken 50 years ago. There can be no better site for constructing a dam, it is a natural dam. Forty, 50 years ago this was decided, and work on the project has begun today,"" he said.

He announced plans to build more dams on rivers to get cheap energy and decrease the pressure on foreign exchange to buy foreign fuel.

The completion of the dam would increase Pakistan's storage capacity from 30 to 48 days and make power generation facilities an attractive future investment by the private sector to add 4,500MW of additional electricity to the national grid, according to a report in Dawn newspaper in May.

Prime minister Khan said that hydropower projects would also be helpful to reduce global warming.

He was accompanied by Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa and ISI chief Lt Gen Faiz Hamid besides Minister for Water Faisal Vawda and other senior officials."	https://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2020/jul/16/imran-kicks-off-construction-of-diamer-bhasha-dam-project-in-pok-despite-indias-objection-2170510.html

ISLAMABAD, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has inaugurated the Diamer Bhasha dam with an installed capacity of 4,500-megawatt electricity production at the River Indus in the country's northwest Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, said an official statement Wednesday.

The dam, scheduled to be completed by 2028, will be the tallest roller compact concrete dam in the world with the height of 272-meter, a 8.1 million acre-feet reservoir and 14 spillway gates. The multipurpose dam will help the country for water storage, flood mitigation, water diversion for irrigation and power generation.

The Diamer Bhasha dam is the country's third-largest dam, after Terbela and Mangla dams, being built at the River Indus.

The Pakistani government signed a contract with a joint venture of Power China and Frontier Works Organization (FWO) for the construction of the dam which will reportedly increase the country's water storage capacity from 30 days to 48 days.

Addressing the inauguration ceremony, the prime minister said that the dam would benefit the country both economically and environmentally especially the local people by creating jobs and supporting their businesses.

The prime minister announced that the government would now move towards building more dams on rivers because these would decrease pressure on foreign exchange reserves of the country by not importing furnace oil for power production.

""We need to learn from China in the building of dams. Pakistan is going to build its only the third big dam while China has already built thousands of big dams which played a vital role in its development,"" said the prime minister, expressing thanks to China for support in the project.

In a separate statement, Special Assistant to the prime minister on Information Asim Saleem Bajwa said after the power plant, water reservoir will be added 1.2 million acres for agriculture, produce cheaper, greener hydropower and will create 16,000 jobs by boosting different sectors.

Active	"‘Military tactics are like water, for water in its natural course runs away from high places and hastens downwards’.

-Sun Tsu, Annals of War

The importance Chinese give to Sun Tsu’s teachings can be gauged from the fact that one of the first acts of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) on taking over the Galwan Valley in Ladakh was to send bulldozers in order to block the flow of the Galwan river as it enters the Indian side.

One interpretation being given is that the Chinese have blocked the river to build a mini dam. Others claim that since the Galwan river flows along the road built by the Indian government, this water could be used whenever required by the Chinese to create a flash flood.

What satellite pictures also reveal is that what was once a blue flowing stream of water is now a muddy dry bed on which the Indian army has parked its trucks.

For the Chinese, water is a key weapon in their expansionist designs. This is obvious in the way they are building huge dams to block the flow of rivers including the Indus, Brahmaputra and the Mekong. This helps them control the quantity of water flowing into the lower riparian countries including India thereby using water to further their own geopolitics.

From the start, India has expressed concern about the construction of the Diamer-Bhasha dam being built on the river Indus in Gilgit-Baltistan which India claims to be its territory.

The MoU for the Diamer-Bhasha dam was signed last month between the Chinese state-run firm China Power and the Pakistan army’s commercial wing Frontier Works Organisation and is expected to be completed by 2028.

The Diamer-Bhasha dam, which will have a height of 272 metres, will be the highest roller-compacted concrete dam in the world and produce 4,500 megawatts of electricity.

Next in line is the Bunji dam, also being built on the Indus river with an installed capacity of 7,100 mw. A large portion of the capital for this construction will come from the Three Gorges Corporation.

The sheer scale of this venture can be assessed from the fact that these dams are much larger than any existing dam in India. In fact, the entire installed hydropower projects in Jammu & Kashmir do not equal even the Bhasha Dam, which is the smaller of these two dams.

These two mammoth dams are part of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of the Chinese government to bolster their economic and geopolitical footprint across a swathe of nations.

China is also planning to build 55 reservoirs on the rivers flowing from the Tibetan plateau. They completed construction of the Zangmu dam, built on the upper reaches of the Brahmaputra in 2010.

Three more dams at Dagu, Jiacha and Jeixu are presently under construction. In 2015, work started on the Zam hydropower station – which will be the largest dam on the Brahmaputra river - which the Chinese refer to as the Yarlung Tsangpo.

Medog which is located just 30 km north of the Indian border is the site for this mega project as the river makes a huge bend inside a giant canyon, which is around 198 miles long and 3.1 miles wide.

The Chinese are using the entire team which built the Three Gorges dam to execute these mammoth projects, expected to generate 40,000 mw of power. Water from this dam will be diverted to irrigate the arid regions of Xingjian and the Gansu in China.

India has rightly been apprehensive about these hydro projects on the Brahmaputra and as far back as 2013, it had lodged a complaint to China. An Inter-Ministerial Expert Group was set up to study this issue but nothing much has come out of this.

Post-Pathankot attack, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that blood and water cannot flow together and that he might well consider abrogation of the Indus Water Treaty if Pakistan does not end these militant attacks, China went public with its plan to build a large dam, with an investment of $740 million, on Xiabuqu river, close to the city of Xigaze located close to Bhutan and Sikkim.

Brahmaputra Authority

Chandan Mahanta, who heads the Centre for Environment at IIT Guwahati and is an expert on the Brahmaputra river basin, has for the last decade been demanding the setting up of a Brahmaputra River Valley Authority to undertake a comprehensive study of the Brahmaputra basin.

Mahanta points out that with China building four dams on the Brahmaputra, it was imperative that India gets details of the kind of dams they are constructing and how this will affect the river flows as otherwise, Brahmputra would end up becoming a seasonal river.

China’s open-and-closed-tap policy is best illustrated when it refused post-Doklam in 2017 to share hydrological data on the Brahmaputra with India but continued to do so with Bangladesh which is the lowest downstream country of the Brahmaputra.

These apprehensions are now being expressed across Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam. China has already built eight huge dams on the Mekong river and another three dams are on the cards.

This has adversely affected the livelihoods on 60 million people dependent on this river for their fishing and agricultural requirements.

China today is on an expansionistic mode. It has now set its eyes on the waters from Indira Col drain to the Siachen glacier and also the Nubra and Shyok rivers of Ladakh.

This may sound far-fetched but till a few weeks ago, no one would have imagined they would sweep across the Galwan Valley either."	https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/comment/using-dams-as-weapons-855209.html

Islamabad - The water storage capacity in the country’s reservoirs have reduced by almost 30 per cent or 5 MAF owing to silting in the last five decades and the proposed hydropower projects to be completed till 2025 the country will only achieve the storage it has lost since 1960s.

Overall all the three dams water reservoirs have lost around 5 MAF space or 30 percent due to siltation in the reservoirs, with Chashma leading the row with 61 percent or 0.440, Tarbela 41 percent or 3.80 MAF and Mangla 11 percent or 0.881 MAF, official documents available with The Nation reveals.

The water reservoirs in the country have lost up 30 percent or 5 MAF storage capacity in the last around five decades and with the proposed hydropower projects to be completed till 2025 the country will only achieve the storage it has lost since 1960s.

Initially the storage capacity in the country’s three reservoirs was 18.645 MAF but was reduced to 13.681 MAF as around 4.965 MAF was lost due to siltation. The installed hydropower generation capacity in the country is 9406 MW.

To enhance the country’s water storage and hydropower generation capacity currently at three different levels efforts are under way which includes the federal government and WAPDA projects, provincial projects and the projects executed through Private Power Infrastructure Board. The federal government and WAPDA are executing three different categories of future projects and they includes short term, medium term and long term. The water reservoir projects that are planned to be completed till 2025 will hardly take the country storage capacity to the level when all the reservoirs had their full capacity.

The short term projects cover the period till 2025 and water projects will have the storage capacity of 5 MAF water storage and with the hydropower generation of 4600 MW. The hydro power projects include Mohmand,Nai Gaj,Naulong, Kurram Tangi-I,Sindh Barrage,Keyal Khwar, Dasu (Stage-I),Tarbela 5th Ext and Harpo HPP. The medium term projects cover are likely to be completed till 2030 and dams being constructed in this period will have the storage capacity of 8 MAF and will generate 16,000 MW of electricity. The project include, Diamir Bhasha dam,Dasu (Stage-II), Kurram Tangi-II, Chiniot, Bara, Tank Zam, Murunj, Hingol, Dudhnial, Thakot, Patan, Lower Palas, Phandar, Basho.

In the long term focusing on 2050 the proposed hydropower projects have the storage capacity of 28 MAF and power generation of 18,400 MW. The proposed hydroprojects are Shyok, KBD (Subject to consensus among the Provinces),Skardu, Mid Ranjha, Akhori, Dhok Abbaki, Rohtas, Bunji,Yulbo and Tangus Till 2050 when the final phase of the hydropower projects will be completed it is hoped that the country will add 39000 MW hydropower to the system and the storage capacity will increase to 41 MAF. However all the projects in three phases are subject to approval and funds availability.

Beside the hydropower projects executed by the federal government and WAPDA, there are several hydropowers being implemented by provinces and PPIB. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) government is also executing hundrads of small and medium size hydroprojects.

The capacity of small hydroprojects starts from 1 MW while in the medium size projects the provincial government is executing project with 500 MW capacity.

Similarly, Private Power Infrastructure Board (PPIB) is currently handling 17 hydropower projects of 6,550 MW in the private sector which are at different stages of implementation."	https://nation.com.pk/10-Feb-2020/water-reservoirs-capacity-reduced-by-30pc

ISLAMABAD - Twenty Three percent work on the phase-I of Kurram Tangi Hydro Project, in North Waziristan, has been completed and the PC-I related to the command area development of the project will be moved to the CDDWP for approval.

The phase-I of the Kaitu Weir power project which will also generate 18.9MW electricity will be completed by April 2019, official documents available with The Nation said.

The project is located across Kurram river in North Waziristan Agency about 14 KMs upstream of Kurram Garhi Head works and 32KMs North of Bannu City in previously Federally Administrated Tribal Area (Fata).

According the documents the Kurrum Tangi Dam Project (KTDP) is multipurpose water development projects located across Kurram and Kaitu Weir river in North Waziristan district of KP.

Kurrum Tangi dam project (KTDP) is divided in two phases which include Phase-I, Kaitu Weir hydro power project, and Phase-II, Kurrum Tangi dam project (KTDP).

Work on Kaitu Weir project has been started in 2016 and the project will have a height of 18 ft and Feeder Tunnel Discharge Capacity will be 633.4 cusecs.

The project is schedeuled to be completed by April 2019 and on completion the project will generate 18.9 Megawatt of electricity and will irrigate around 16380 acres of land.

Kaitu Weir has further been divided into two components which includes Kaitu Weir hydro project, development of affiliated structure and development of command area the project.

The first component is being executed by Wapda while the second one by FATA Secretariat. American aid agency USAID is funding the main portion of the Kaitu Weir Hydro project while Italian government is funding development of command area of the project.

The total cost of the project is Rs4740.11 billion which will be shared by local ADP of Rs295.18 million and Rs 4444.93 billion by the Italian government. The project will be completed in three years.

The phase-II of the KTDP will start later which includes the dam height of 322 ft and it has the gross storage capacity of 1.20 MAF while it will generate 83.4 MW (350 GWh) electricity. The total command Area of the project is 84,380 acres which will be irrigated through Sheratalla Canal 12,300 acres, Spaira Ragha Canal 4,080 acres and Thal Canal 68,000 acres.

The working paper of command area development of Kaitu Weir project has already been submitted to the Ministry of Planning Development and Reforms and will be tabled to the upcoming meeting of Central Development Working Party (CDWP) for approval."	https://nation.com.pk/14-Aug-2018/work-on-kurram-tangi-dam-in-full-swing

Lahore - With a view to optimal utilization of water and hydropower resources in the country, Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA), which has succeeded to accomplish three power projects of around 2,500MW this year, is now working on another eight hydropower projects and water reservoirs with cumulative power generation capacity of 9,832MW and gross water storage capacity of 11 million acre feet (MAF). The projects have suffered inordinate delays primarily due to financial issues, absence of political will, poor planning, lack of transparency and uncertain law and order situation.

Officials in Water and Power Ministry said three hydropower projects, including Neelum Jhelum, Tarbela 4th Extension and Golen Gol with electricity generation capacity of 2,485 MW in total, were completed in Feb, March and April this year respectively. In addition, Phase-I of Kachhi Canal was also completed in Sept 2017 to irrigate 72,000 acres of land in Dera Bugti, Balochistan.

The ongoing hydropower projects included 83MW Kurram Tangi hydro power project with water storage capacity of 0.9 MAF, 4,320MW Dasu hydropower project, 4,500MW Diamer Bhasha hydro power project also having water storage capacity of 6.4MAF, 800MW Mohmand hydropower project with water storage capacity of 0.67MAF and 128MW Keyal Khwar hydropower project. As per the documents available with The Nation, the stage-I of 83MW Kurram Tangi hydropower project is expected to be completed in 2019 while stage-I of the run of the river (RoR) Dasu project is likely to commission in 2022. The Bhasha Dam will take at least nine years if construction work on main dam is started now while 800MW Mohmand hydropower project will be completed in six years after start of construction work on main dam. Officials said the RoR Keyal Khwar project may be completed in five years, as its construction work has not been started yet. Once completed, these projects will go a long way in fulfilling the increasing requirements of water and power.

The under construction water reservoirs included Nai Gaj Dam with 0.16MAF water storage capacity (51 percent completed), Muzaffargarh & TP Link Canal lining (40 percent completed), RBOD-I (82 percent completed) and RBOD-III (84 percent completed).

The Right Bank Outfall Drain (RBOD) is an important drainage project aimed at carrying effluent from upper Sindh and Balochistan to the Arabian Sea through the Gharo creek in Thatta district. According to the sources, the three phases of the project, including RBOD-I, II and III, have been hit by cost overruns in the last 15 years for one reason or the other. The three phases of the RBOD are being completed at a cost of around Rs90 billion.

The first and third phases are being executed by Wapda while the second phase, executed by the Sindh government through the Frontier Works Organisation, is designed to bypass Manchar Lake destroyed by wastewater. They said slow fund releases have largely affected the work progress. The first and third phases of the RBOD are slated to be completed in November 2019 and the RBOD-II in June 2019.

Officials said Wapda is planning to start construction work on Diamer Bhasha Dam and Mohmand Dam this year. Stage-I of Dasu Hydropower Project will come on line in 2022, while Stage-II will be completed in 2025, both stages will add 4320 MW to the national grid. Kurram Tangi Dam Project, being constructed in North Waziristan, will be implemented in two phases.

Water and energy experts said the Chief Justice of Pakistan’s intervention at this critical juncture for timely and urgent commencement of Diamer Bhasha and Mohmand Dam projects is a turning point in our water history wherein equally focused and committed federal government support is the dawn of a new era.

They said Diamer–Bhasha Dam site was located across Indus River Near Chilas (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa & Gilgit- Baltistan), 315 km u/s from Tarbela Dam and about 40 Km downstream of Chilas.

The dam of 272-meter height will provide a reservoir with live storage of 6.4 MAF water, which will be utilised for supplementing the irrigation water to Indus Basin and hydropower generation of 18,097 GWh per annum with the help of hydropower plant with installed capacity of 4500 MW.

They said Mohmand Dam site is proposed to be constructed on Swat River about 5 km upstream (u/s) of Munda Head Works in tribal district, Mohmand of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

The dam of 213-meter height will provide a reservoir with live storage of 0.676 MAF which will be utilized for irrigation of new command area of 16,737 acres, water supply to Peshawar, hydropower generation of 2,864 GWh per annum with installed capacity of 800 MW besides mitigating floods in Peshawar valley.

Energy experts said the major factor contributing to the widening electricity demand-supply gap was the delay in the completion of various hydropower projects undertaken by the Wapda.

The sustainable development projects, if completed timely, could directly address the prevalent energy crisis and also result in reducing the average generation cost of the energy mix. The typical example of inordinate delay was that of the Neelum-Jhelum hydroelectric project, which was conceived decades ago for fast-track implementation, but its construction contract was awarded in 2007. It was to achieve commercial operations within five years, but the completion date was revised a number of times due to multiple reasons.

Similarly, the Golen Gol project of 106MW was scheduled for commissioning in 2009, but completed after a long delay. The Keyal Khwar hydropower project of 122MW has already been delayed by more than a decade, and no construction was started yet though its civil works contract was given in 2014.

Other accomplished hydropower projects that suffered long delays in the past included Jinnah (96MW), Duber Khwar (130MW), Allai Khwar (121MW), Khan Khwar (72MW) and Satpara (0.05MAF). The Jinnah project in Mianwali district was planned for construction in 2006, with a completion deadline of four years, but it was commissioned in September 2013.

Experts said Pakistani engineers with support of international experts, soon after the independence of the country, achieved the marvels of two largest dams of that time, five barrages, seven link canals and second largest grid station of Asia after Japan.

They said Pakistan has been degraded from water abundant country to scarce country in view of massive population growth, insufficient water storage and poor management mechanism.

They said minimum storage of fresh water of only ten percent of 145 MAF and only 30 days’ carryover capacity much lower than the world average makes it a water insecure country. They said groundwater is now being overexploited in many areas and quality is deteriorating, which is leading to a large percentage of salt water.

They observed large part of Pakistan has good soil, abundant sunshine and able farmers yet crop yields are much lower. The quality of water service and irrigation practices play major role, this must improve phenomenally."	https://nation.com.pk/29-Oct-2018/wapda-working-on-eight-power-projects-of-9-832mw

Active	"–Lt Gen Asim provides final push to project as government crosses ‘line of reluctance’

ISLAMABAD: After 40 long years of planning and political wrangling on the Diamer-Bhasha Dam project, Pakistan has finally crossed the ‘line of reluctance’ by announcing to start the construction work on the project.

Officials said that over the past four decades, the project could not commence due to lack of political will and reluctance of the executive authority due to conspiracy theories and negative propaganda launched by the enemy under ‘5th generation war’.

However, Prime Minister Imran Khan decided to go ahead with the project and tasked former Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) director-general and incumbent China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) Authority Chairman Lieutenant General (r) Asim Saleem Bajwa to ensure immediate execution of the project. Since overtaking the job, he has been instrumental in pushing the project and due to his efforts, the project is now ready for start of construction work at the project.

Last week, the government signed a contract of Rs442 billion with China Power for the construction of the Diamer-Bhasha Dam. The Chinese firm is executing the project in a joint venture with Frontier Works Organisation (FWO).

The Chinese state-run firm holds 70 per cent and the FWO, a commercial arm of the Pakistan Armed Forces, has 30 per cent share in the consortium. The contract covers construction of a diversion system, main dam, access bridge and the 21MW Tangir Hydropower Project.

Amir Bashir Chaudhry, the chief executive officer of the project, and the authorised representative of China Power Yang Jiandu signed the agreement on behalf of the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) and the Chinese company, respectively. Water Resources Minister Faisal Vawda, Chinese Ambassador Yao Jing, Water Resources Secretary Mohammad Ashraf, WAPDA Chairman Lieutenant General (r) Muzammil Hussain, Pakistan Army Engineer-In-Chief Lieutenant Gen Moazzam Ejaz and FWO Director General Major General Kamal Azfar attended the signing ceremony.

The WAPDA chairman expressed the hope that the Diamer-Bhasha Dam would be completed as per the timeline to cope with the increasing water and electricity requirements of the country. The dam project with a total financial outlay of about Rs1,406.5 billion would be completed in 2028, he added.

He also said that the total financial outlay includes land acquisition and resettlement, confidence building measures for social uplift of the local people, construction of dam and power houses. He added that the project would have a gross storage capacity of 8.1 eight million-acre feet and power generation capacity of 4,500MW, with an annual generation of 18.1 billion units, however, the electromechanical and power generation project would be taken up separately at a later stage.

The dam will help provide cheap energy for the country’s industrial development besides helping irrigate 1.23 million acres of barren land mostly in Sindh province. The irrigation would also help the country develop its food needs and also export vegetables and food resources while it would also deter floods.

An official said the concerned departments are monitoring the rise of anti-dam propaganda on social media sites which needs to be countered with facts and awareness campaign is being designed in this regard. The official hoped that patriotic Pakistanis would castoff the propaganda against the dam.

The eight MAF reservoir with 272-metre height would be the tallest roller compact concrete (RCC) dam in the world. It would have a spillway, 14 gates and five outlets for flushing out silt. The diversion system would involve two tunnels and a diversion canal — all three having one kilometre length each. The bridge — a box girder structure — under the contract would be constructed downstream of the dam structure while the 21MW power plant would be built to meet energy requirements of the project during construction.

WAPDA has already awarded a contract of Rs27.182 billion for dam’s consultancy services to Diamer-Bhasha Consultants Group (DBCG). The consultancy agreement includes construction design, construction supervision and contract administration of the dam project.

The DBCG joint venture comprises 12 top-ranked national and foreign consulting firms — Nespak (Pakistan), Associate Consulting Engineers (Pakistan), Mott MacDonald Pakistan, Poyry (Switzerland), Montgomery Watson and Harza (MWH) International-Stantec (USA), Dolsar Engineering (Turkey), Mott McDonald International (England), China Water Resources Beifang Investigation, Design and Research Company (China), Mirza Associates Engineering Services (Pakistan), Al-Kasib Group of Engineering Services (Pakistan), Development Management Consultant (Pakistan) and MWH Pakistan, with Nespak as the lead firm. These firms have a vast experience of providing consultancy services for mega water projects the world over.

The Diamer-Bhasha Dam has been studied since 1980’s. Its preliminary feasibility was carried out by MONENCO of Canada and they proposed an Earth Core Rockfill Dam (ECRD) with a cutoff wall through 40 meters thick alluvium of Indus.

An official said that a detailed feasibility study was carried out by NEAC Consultants, including top-notch world class consultants like Montgomery Watson Harza of the United States and Binnie Blac & Veatch of the United Kingdom.

The official said that a very pertinent point is that different group of consultants have designed dams on the Indus River in the same area, where the geology and seismicity is pretty similar. These include the Bunji Dam and Dasu Dam among others, he said.

He also said that the Diamer-Bhasha Dam has gone through three phases from investigations to design from pre-feasibility (1884) to detailed design (2008). World renowned and best Pakistani firms have worked and completed the design. Now the dam design is ready for construction, he added.

The official said that all dams in the world are built in mountainous regions, as dam sites are in such regions. He added that it is also established that all mountainous regions are seismically active.

He further said that dams have to be designed to withstand earthquakes. Rigorous design standards and technical guidelines are available to design the dams to withstand earthquakes and all such world accepted world standards have been applied to the design of Diamer-Bhasha Dam."	https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2020/05/19/diamer-bhasha-dams-construction-set-commence-40-years-delay/
Active	"ISLAMABAD: Amid the launch of the construction of Diamer-Bhasha dam, the government on Wednesday said the decision to build it as a ‘roller compact concrete (RCC)’ structure was based on 20-year intensive scrutiny of technical and geological reports and feasibility studies by an international panel of experts.

Speaking at a news conference, Wapda chairman retired Lt Gen Muzammil Hussain said the project was initially among a list of 8-10 major projects identified by a Canadian consultant in the early 1980s and the choice for RCC dam was based on pre-feasibility and feasibility studies of the time.

According to him, the World Bank, which had originally agreed to support the project, appointed an international panel of experts from the US, the UK, Canada, etc, in 1997-98 under a regime of evaluation and approved it be built on RCC technology instead of earthfill or rockfill dam in view of the local topography, rainfalls patterns, etc.

Decision to build Diamer-Bhasha as a ‘roller compact concrete’ structure based on intensive scrutiny of technical, geological reports

In 2002-04, another panel of experts engaged by Wapda/government of Pakistan and led by Australian dam experts also concluded that RCC dam was best suited for Diamer-Bhasha because of expected glacial lake outburst floods in the Indus region and the fear that resultant overtopping flows could damage earthfill and rockfill structures downstream and the RCC was found to be a safe technology.

Moreover, the RCC was also found suitable from economic viability standpoint as this allows low level outlets, spillways and water passages within the main structure. This is not possible for earthfill or rockfill dam for which separate space is required. This was once again confirmed by another panel of experts in 2007-08.

On top of that, Lehmayr of Germany prepared a detailed design of the dam supporting the RCC option, which was again confirmed by a panel of experts. As such, the whole process concluding the RCC dam spanned over a period of 20-25 years.

Not only this, all experts have concluded that all dams on the Indus cascade should be RCC structures, including Bunji, Dasu, Pattan and Thakot.

In reply to a question, the Wapda chairman said the entire Rs480 billion financing for the dam was not required at the outset nor Wapda intended to contract this financing to pay management fee and other charges and hence it would complete financing in a staggered manner.

He said the government had committed Rs30-35bn per year to meet its 30 per cent cost sharing, while Wapda itself had Rs100bn its own equity. He said the total estimated cost of the project was about Rs1.407 trillion of which the dam cost was about Rs480bn. About Rs97bn cost is going to land acquisition and about Rs79bn on confidence building measures to secure support of the local population required to be dislocated and given alternative residence and other facilities like roads, schools and hospitals. He said the cost of power generation facility was estimated at Rs751bn but that would be required at a later stage.

Mr Hussain said the government would meet about 30pc or Rs406bn share of the total project cost, while the remaining Rs997bn or 70pc would be arranged by Wapda through Rs100bn equity, besides commercial financing, Eurobonds, etc.

He said three leading international rating agencies — Fitsch, Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s — had rated Wapda as a stable entity.

Responding to another question, Mr Hussain said two joint ventures had competed for the dam contract — the China Gezhouba Group and its local partner and Power China and Frontier Works Organisation (FWO). The Power China and FWO won the project through an evaluation committee constituted by the Supreme Court.

Also, an implementation committee constituted again by the Supreme Court and including leading figures like Eng Shamsul Mulk and Sardar Tariq would also oversee the project, besides the normal Wapda institutional oversight through a committee comprising all provincial governments, projects consultants and the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority.

He said Wapda had ensured fast track mobilisation of contractors and machinery had already reached Chilas. He said the key target was to ensure completion of all diversions in two-three years, followed by construction of dam and power facilities in about five years so that the project could be commissioned by 2028 and to ensure its completion within approved costs.

Responding to a question, the Wapda chairman said India had committed a number of violations of the Indus Waters Treaty on the western rivers and was bent upon usurping Pakistan’s water rights, but those violations had nothing to do with this mega dam.

He said the Diamer-Bhasha dam area was very much part of Pakistan. “We are building the dam within our territory. The objections being raised by India are irrelevant, frivolous and ridiculous,” he added.

He said the project had remained stuck for decades due to various reasons which had been addressed and it would be completed within the stipulated deadline of 2028 to achieve its main purposes of water storage and production of 4,500MW of cheap and affordable electricity for meeting energy requirements of the country.

On the occasion, Minister for Water Resources Faisal Vawda said the contractors and machinery had reached Chilas city in Gilgit-Baltistan to formally begin construction work on the project that had full support of the armed forces and Strategic Services Division and the government of China without which the project could not have reached this stage.

He said the Diamer-Bhasha dam would change the destiny of the country and no spoiler would be able to jeopardise the project. He said the project was being initiated at a time when nobody was ready to take up such a huge project anywhere in the world.

The project would generate about 16,500 jobs and reinvigorate cement, steel and transport sectors as about 1,000 trucks would daily move on the roads to supply material to the dam site, the minister said.

Chinese Ambassador Yao Jing said it was a historic day for the people and the government of Pakistan to move the project to construction phase after four decades of planning and designing exercise. He said it was a very significant project that would support Pakistan’s economy and greatly contribute to irrigation, environment and energy sectors, besides controlling national disasters.

He said the contractor — Power China — was the most experienced public sector company of this field and had to its credit the construction of Three Gorges Dam.

The 6.4 MAF water storage capacity of the dam will reduce the current water shortage in the country of 12 MAF to 6.1 MAF. It will add 35 years to the life of Tarbela Dam by reducing sedimentation. An area of 1.23 million acres of land will be brought under agriculture due to this dam.

Chairman Water and Power and Development Authority (WAPDA) Lt Gen Muzammil Hussain (R) Tuesday briefed the Federal Minister for Water Resources Syed Ali Zafar about the issues of water and hydro-power sectors in the country.

Mirpur, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 26th Jun, 2018 ) :Chairman Water and Power and Development Authority (WAPDA) Lt Gen Muzammil Hussain (R) Tuesday briefed the Federal Minister for Water Resources Syed Ali Zafar about the issues of water and hydro-power sectors in the country.

The Minister who visited WAPDA House, apprised of WAPDA projects, particularly Diamer Basha Dam and Mohmand Dam, WAPDA sources said.

Dilating upon the efforts made by WAPDA to cope with the increasing needs of water and electricity, the Chairman said that WAPDA succeeded in completing as many as for four mega projects from August 2017 onwards to irrigate 72, 000 acres of barren land in Dera Bugti, Balochistan and added 2487 MW of hydel electricity to the National Grid.

These projects included Phase 1 of Kachhi Canal, Golen Gol, Tarbela 4th Extension and Neelum Jhelum Hydro-power Project.

Stage 1 of Kurram Tangi Dam Project is scheduled to be completed in 2020, while the 2160 MW Stage 1 of Dasu Hydropower Project is likely to start electricity generation by 2023,he informed.

The Minister was further briefed that construction work on Diamer Basha Dam Project and Mohmand Dam would be started in fiscal year 2018-19.The gigantic Diamer Basha Dam Project has a gross water storage capacity of 8.1 MAF and power generation capacity of 4500 MW. Likewise Mohmand Dam Hydro-power Project will store 1.2 MAF water and generate 800 MW electricity. Both projects are vital to attain water and energy security in the country, therefore, all stakeholders should play their due role in initiation and timely completion of these projects. The 1410 MW- Tarbela 5th Extension, the 2160 MW-Stage II of Dasu, the 7100 MW-Bunji and the Stage II of multi purpose Kurram Tangi Dam among the ready-for-construction projects.

Speaking on the occasion, the Minister expressed satisfaction over the measures being taken by WAPDA to implement its projects in water and hydro-power sectors. He was of the view that concerted efforts are required both at federal and provincial levels to steer the country out of the impending water crisis."	https://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/minister-discusses-issues-of-water-and-hydro-382121.html
Active	"P akistan is being deprived of millions of units (kWh) low-cost energy on an annual basis that could be contributed to national grid system. The hydropower experts believe that ten old power generating units of Tarbela hydropower station, if overhauled and modernised, can be safely operated at much higher capacity, adding at least 200 megawatt (MW) during high-demand summer season, to available and reliable capacity of these units.

Tarbela Dam, completed in 1976, is not only the largest earth-and-rock filled dam of the times it is also the 5th largest structure by volume in the world. Globally, it is ranked the 8th largest dam and has installed world’s largest manifold for penstock for the powerhouse. It has been a challenge in dams design and construction, given the geological conditions of the site. Among various other distinctions that the multipurpose Tarbela project enjoys, its hydropower station is the largest power station in the country with an installed capacity of 4,888 MW, playing critical role in energy security and sustainability. The international experts consider Tarbela power station to have been satisfactorily operated and well-maintained by Pakistani engineers, despite various technical and financial constraints.

There are five tunnels for irrigation supply releases and for power generation, which, in fact, is the secondary function of the Tarbela project. According to the original design, three of the right bank tunnels (Tunnel No 1, 2 and 3) are being used for power generation whereas the remaining tunnels (Tunnel No.4 on the right bank and No.5 on the left bank) were, till recently, being used exclusively for irrigation releases. Provision of an additional tunnel was also made on the right bank for subsequent development, which was constructed in 2002-03 known as Gandaf Tunnel.

Sometime in the 1980s, Water & Power Development Authority (WAPDA) carried out a power optimisation study at Tarbela project, and it was conceived that Tunnel No 4 could also be utilised for power generation without affecting the irrigation releases. Thus, the 4th Extension of Tarbela project, of total 1,410 MW installed capacity (three units of 470 MW each), was proposed and implemented after modification of Tunnel No 3 and No 4 intakes. Tarbela 4th Extension project was commissioned in October 2018 that has enhanced Tarbela powerhouse capacity to 4,888 MW, ranking it as the 15th largest hydropower station in the world. Now WAPDA has launched the 5th Extension of Tarbela powerhouse of the same size, 1,410 MW, on existing Tunnel No 5, which, on completion, will bring total installed capacity of Tarbela power station to 6,298 MW.

In the first phase of Tarbela powerhouse project, ten generating units of 175 MW capacity each (Units 1 to 4 on Tunnel No 1, and Units 5 to 10 on Tunnel No 2) were installed during the 1977-1985 period. Four additional units, each of 432 MW capacity were commissioned on Tunnel No 3 under the 3rd Extension of Tarbela hydropower project in February 1993. The first ten generating units i.e. Units 1 to 10 of cumulative installed capacity 1,750 MW are ageing and obsolescing, and require major overhauling, refurbishment, and modernisation of electro-mechanical equipment.

During the past two decades or so there have been major advancements in materials and developments in design & engineering in the field of hydropower the world over. This has resulted in improved output, efficiency and reliability of hydropower plant, besides its increased service life. There is great potential for not only regaining the original installed capacity of the Tarbela powerhouse old Units 1 to 10, but also increasing their efficiency and capability to generate more than the rated capacity under overload conditions, if state-of-the-art technology is employed by replacing outmoded machinery and components. These Units have the flexibility to be operated on higher than the rated capacity, at least to ten percent, as allowed by the equipment manufacturer, and as demonstrated in the past by the Tarbela management.

Units I to 4, commissioned in 1977, of rated capacity of 175 MW each were being operated up to 210 MW at high reservoir level till the year 1995. However, with the passage of time the capability and efficiency of these Units deteriorated. At one time, Unit 4 was giving not more than 87 MW. Under WAPDA’s short-term Repair and Maintenance Programme financed by the US Agency for International Development (USAID), Generators of Units 1, 3, and 4 were rehabilitated during 2011-14 (Unit 2 was rehabilitated earlier, in 1997). Generator windings of these Units were replaced with the latest Class-F insulated windings, possessing a higher degree of thermal stability compared to the old Class-B insulation. Likewise, the Excitation System of these Units have recently been replaced with latest static excitation system. Resultantly, these Units have regained their original installed capacity of 175-MW. Currently, in the month of May, Units 1 to 4 are operating at 162 MW each due to non-availability of required waterhead.

In fact, these Units could be loaded safely up to 200 MW each. The limitation of these Units is now that of the Turbines, which have not been overhauled and rehabilitated since commissioning more than four decades, having already completed their useful life. Turbine Runners of these Units have worn out due to ageing, having developed serious problem of vibrations experienced beyond 175 MW and Power Swing phenomenon (power fluctuation), resulting in overload instabilities.

Runners of these four Turbines need to be replaced with the new ones, designed using modern technology of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), having X-Blade hydrodynamic contours, instead of the conventional existing design. The X-Blade Runner technology has been developed in the West to provide improved stability to the hydraulic turbines over large ranges of water inflow and head, as well as strong cavitation behavior and higher efficiency levels. The technology is being successfully used the world over also to upgrade existing turbines in hydropower plants.

Likewise, Units 5 to 8 were installed and commissioned in 1983-84. With the passage of time, capacity and efficiency of the Units have got badly affected. None of these Units can be loaded beyond 175 MW due to problem of abnormal vibrations in Turbine. Also, Generators of these Units are already due for replacement with Class-F insulated Stator Windings. Generator Exciters and Turbine Governors of these Units have recently been replaced with digitally controlled system. Simply replacing Turbine Runners with X-Blade CFD design and new Stator Windings of Generators will enhance capability of these Units to 200-MW each, achieving maximum efficiency.

Similar is the situation with Units 9 & 10, which were installed and commissioned in 1985. Initially, these two Units were also operated at 201-MW during high reservoir level. However, with the passage of time Turbine Runner developed vibrations at high water-head, and thus performance and maximum capability of both Units suffered. Recently, Generator Stator Windings of these Units were replaced with new one having Class-F insulation. Also, the Exciters and Turbine Governors were modified and replaced with Digital Governors and Static Exciters. The output of these two Units could also be enhanced to 200 MW each by simply replacing the old Turbine Runners with new modern ones, and refurbishment of its existing Guide-vanes.

Thus, all ten Units could be operated, in future, smoothly beyond their rated capacity, additionally to cumulative 250 MW at high waterhead, or to at least 200 MW if requisite waterhead is not available for some period. However, this additional power generation of about 246 GWh net energy would be possible only for two months, and also subject to irrigation releases by the Indus River System Authority (IRSA). Tarbela Reservoir, during a normal year of water inflows, achieves waterhead during end July, and water level is retained latest by end September.

It is therefore imperative for WAPDA to prepare a detailed project study for the rehabilitation, refurbishment and upgradation of the old ten power generating units, for implementation on fast track. Timely and effective execution of the phased programme will result in contributing significant additional power generation during summer, minimising prolonged and forced power outages, and also improving availability of these Units. With the completion of Tarbela 4th Extension project (Units 15 to 17) that basically serves the purpose of power substitution, there has come a greater flexibility for carrying out major overhauling of Units 1 to 10 on the suggested lines, one after the other during water lean-flow periods, without disturbing peak power supplies in winter and baseload power supplies in summer.

PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) government aims to complete hydropower projects totalling 60 megawatts (MW) by December 2020.

Currently, work on seven power projects including a 10.2MW project at Jabori in Mansehra, 11.8MW project at Shangla, 84MW project at Gorkan Mittaltan in Swat, 40.8MW project at Koto in Lower Dir, 69MW Lavi project in Chitral, 300MW project in Balakot and a 10.56MW project at Chapri Charkhel in Kurram district is under way..

Out of the seven projects, two hydo power generation projects in Jabori and Koto will be completed by December 2020, adding more than 60MW of electricity to the system.

According to officials around 84 per cent work on transmission lines has already been completed while the remaining work will be finished until December. Instructions have also been issued for the continuation of the process of approval of tariffs for hydropower projects.

Additionally, the 69MW Lavy Hydropower Project in Chitral will be completed in 2022 while a consultant has been hired for a 300MW Project in Balakat.

Moreover, a consultant is also being hired for the Chapri Charkhel Hydro Project, however, no final date of its completion has been announced so far.

KP has identified four power corridors having potential for several hydropower projects which can help overcome the shortfall in electricity generation. These corridors include areas in Chitral, Dir, Swat, Kohistan and Mansehra.

The corridor in Swat has a total capacity of 1,100MW with Pakhtunkhwa Energy Development Organization (PEDO) having already undertaken a feasibility study for an 84MW Swat-Mittaltan transmission line."	https://profit.pakistantoday.com.pk/2020/07/08/kp-to-complete-work-on-60mw-power-projects-by-december/
Active	"Mott MacDonald has been appointed lead consultant for the 1,410-MW Tarbela 5th Extension hydropower project in Pakistan.

The project, being delivered by the Water and Power Development Authority of Pakistan, will increase the Tarbela Power Plant’s total generating capacity from 4,888 MW to 6,300 MW. The aim of the extension is to increase seasonal power supply in Pakistan to meet increasing demand for electricity.

Mott MacDonald was also lead consultant for the 1,410-MW Tarbela 4 project, which was commissioned in October 2018.

The Tarbela power station, situated below what Mott MacDonald says is the largest earthfill dam in the world, has been steadily developed on the Indus River since it was originally commissioned in 1976. The dam was designed to store water for irrigation, flood control and the generation of hydroelectric power. It is 148 meters high and 3,000 meters long, with two gated spillways and five tunnels that provide irrigation releases and power generation.

The project incorporates a new 1,410-MW hydropower plant to be constructed at the end of an existing 43-year-old tunnel through Tarbela Dam. The project also includes a new 50-km-long 500-kV transmission line and a 20-MW to 40-MW floating solar pilot project, which will be the first in Pakistan, Mott MacDonald says.

Mott MacDonald conducted the feasibility, scoping studies and detailed design for the 5th Extension project of Tarbela. Unlike the other four tunnels, the fifth tunnel is situated within the left abutment of the dam. Using the tunnel for dual purposes, such as irrigation releases and power generation, has presented a unique set of challenges. Many of the challenges relate to its location between two large spillways, their associated plunge pools and a common discharge channel."	https://www.hydroreview.com/2019/06/20/mott-macdonald-named-lead-consultant-for-1-410-mw-tarbela-5th-extension-hydropower-project/
Active	"The Ethiopian Electric Power (EEP) is going to sign its first ever power purchase agreement with Corbetti Geothermal after a long delay on two separate power feeders. The agreement is expected to be sealed off next week.

The company had previously agreed with the then Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation in 2013. They were in the process of producing a total of 1,000MW power at the location called Corbetti and the surrounding area, Shalla Woreda, East Arsi Zone of Oromia, 270km southeast of Addis Ababa.

Mekuria Lemma, Strategy and Investment Director with the EEP, told Capital that the two bodies agreed on a feed in tariff in the beginning. He said that EEP has agreed to pay USD 0.075 cents per kwh for the Corbetti project. The Tulu Moye and Abaya projects which will be developed in the second phase will contribute to Corbetti Geothermal to gain USD 0.069 cents per kwh, according to Mekuria.

“They have a scale advantage on the Tulu Moye and Abaya projects so the price has also been reduced compared with Corbetti,” he added.

If the project becomes effective it would be the first large scale private power project for the country that will be connected with the national greed on the power purchase agreement basis.

Mekuria said that the first phase of the project that will take place at Corbetti will take 7.9 years and enable to generate 500 MW project.

“A Geothermal energy project by its nature is not expected to be fully operational in a few years,” EEP officials said. He said that because of this the power production will reach 500MW in the long run.

“We will receive the first 20MW within two years and it will continue on its growth step by step,” he added

Corgetti Geothermal was initially formed by Ethiopian affiliated company called Rift Valley Geothermal and its Icelandic partner Reykjavik Geothermal. Currently Berkley Energy and Iceland Drilling have joined the company. Berkley is the major shareholder with over 53 percent share.

The two sides that finalized the negotiation in the beginning of the Ethiopian New Year are expected to seal their agreement on Tuesday December 19 at the Sheraton Addis.

The country’s energy development is mainly dominated by hydro power, while wind has become the other alternative. Even though the country has a capacity to produce 10,000mw from geothermal the current production is not higher than 50mw.

On its own project EEP has also planned to generate about 75mw of energy from geothermal at Aluto Langanoo, which is closer to the project of Corbetti Geothermal. But the Aluto project is not going as planned."	https://www.capitalethiopia.com/featured/eep-corbetti-geothermal-ink-first-power-purchase-agreement/

Active	"PESHAWAR: Pakhtunkhwa Energy Development Organisation (PEDO) has entered into an agreement with the Asian Development Bank (ADP) for financing the construction of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s (KP) biggest ever 300 megawatts (MW) hydropower project at a cost of US $ 645 million on Kunhar River near Balakot area of Mansehra.

KP Secretary Finance Shakeel Qadir Khan signed the agreement with ADP in the presence of KP Chief Minister (CM) Pervez Khattak and Provincial Minister for Energy and Power Muhammad Atif, PEDO Chief Planning Officer Syed Zainullah Shah and other high-ranking officers.

The dam site on Kunhar River is at a distance of about three kilometres downstream from Paras village and 17 kilometres upstream of Balakot’s main bridge. The powerhouse would be located on the left bank of Sangarh nullah confluence with Kunhar River, one kilometre upstream of Dabrain village and eight kilometres upstream of Balakot’s main bridge.

The project would be constructed in an environment-friendly way and would not displace the local population, thus contributing a lot to the national energy production at no cost at all. The project would also add over Rs eight billion per annum to the resources of the province. The investment on the project also promised more than 17 per cent return per year.

The PC-1 of the project had already been prepared and would be approved by the Provincial Development Party this week and sent to the Central Development Working Party i.e. the federal government. The ADB had already arranged funds for the project, which would be released in a timely manner (approximately 60 months).

Speaking on the occasion, Pervez Khattak regretted that on the one hand there was a shortage of electricity in the country while on the other hand, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s rich energy resources, particularly environment-friendly low-cost hydel power, were not being utilised by the federal government.

He said that instead of helping the province tap into these resources, the federal government was importing costly LNG. He also regretted that the federal government was neither finalising a purchase agreement regarding the 74 MW hydel power generated in the province to add it to the national grid nor was it paying the price of the electricity generated by KP.

According to a conservative estimate, the province has the capacity to produce 15,000 MW of cheap and environment-friendly hydel power but the federal government was least interested in its development.

Khattak pointed out that the KP government had started work on 2,500 MW hydel power generation from its own meager resources by signing an agreement for 668 MW with the private sector. The province also signed agreements with Frontier Works Organisation (FWO) for the generation of 506 MW energy while another agreement was signed with China for a 610 MW power project.

The chief minister also said that neither the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) nor the federal government were interested in the capacity building of transmission lines in the smaller provinces, due to which the electricity produced on the provincial level could not be transmitted to the national grid."	https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2018/04/24/pedo-adb-ink-agreement-for-300-mw-hydropower-project/

Ethiopia started long-term geothermal exploration in 1969. Since the late 1970s, geoscientific surveys mostly comprising geology, geochemistry, and geophysics, were carried out, from south to north, leading to prospective projects at Abaya, Corbetti, Aluto Langano, Tulu Moye and Tendaho (Teklemariam and Beyene, 2005).

The explored prospects in the country are at various stages of exploration and include:

more advanced prospects where exploration drilling has been conducted (Aluto Langano and Tendaho), prospects where surface exploration is relatively at a higher level (Abaya, Corbetti, Tulu Moye and Fentale and Dofan), and prospects where surface exploration is at a lower level and warrants further exploration (Kone, Meteka, Teo, Danab, L. Abe and Dallol).

Let’s explore two projects that have made the most progress. Corbetti and Tulu Moye, located in the Rift Valley, are expected to produce a combined 1,000MW of power when they reach full completion. In 2017, the government signed a $4 billion contract for the construction of Corbetti.

“No doubt the success of this effort will have a significant impact on the country’s future economic well-being,” noted former chief executive of Ethiopian Electric Power (EEP), Azeb Asnake.

The equity investors in the Corbetti project include the Paris-based asset manager Meridiam, Africa Renewable Energy Fund, and InfraCo Africa – funds that focus on infrastructure investment.

To raise further capital for the geothermal project, in 2018 InfraCo Africa signed a shareholder agreement with Berkeley Energy, committing $30 million of equity investment to the geothermal project. The project will be operated by the developers for a period of 25 years. To manage the early stage development risks and costs associated with being a pioneer, Corbetti will be developed in multiple phases.

The first phase, wholly equity funded, will drill up to six exploratory wells and build a small power plant. This initial phase will demonstrate the viability of the geothermal resource and the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), enabling the project to raise further investment.

The second phase will raise debt financing to drill a further 9-13 wells and construct a 50-60MW commercial-scale power plant and facilities. Totalling 150MW, the full Corbetti programme will enable the government to meet 18% of its ambition to generate 840MW from geothermal sources by 2025.

In March 2020, the project’s investors signed a PPA and implementation agreement with the government of Ethiopia and EEP. The signings allow the project to move into the next phase of implementation, and to commence the drilling programme. InfraCo Africa’s CEO, Gilles Vaes, said: “We remain committed to developing geothermal power in Ethiopia during these challenging times and are excited to be taking the next steps together and in close partnership with EEP and the government of Ethiopia, to realise this ambitious project.”

The project developers have also committed to extending the plant’s development impact by adding ‘bolt-on’ water initiatives, where possible.

Progress has been steady on the Tulu Moye geothermal power project. Also in March 2020, the AfDB endorsed a decision by the Trust Fund Committee of the Clean Technology Fund (CTF), one of two funds within the Climate Investment Funds (CIF), to extend a $10 million concessional senior loan for the development of this project.

“We welcome the participation of CTF in this project. These concessional resources will be instrumental in helping the country to diversify its energy mix by facilitating the deployment of renewable energy technologies while supporting Ethiopia in meeting the targets under its National Electrification Plan 2.0,” said Anthony Nyong, the director of climate change and green growth at the Bank.

The Tulu Moye project entails the design, construction, commissioning and operation of a 50MW geothermal power plant under a Build, Own, Operate and Transfer scheme. The project will include a sub-station and an 11km transmission line.

Antony Karembu, the principal investment officer and renewable energy specialist at the AfDB, noted that as one of the first geothermal IPPs in the country, CTF will leverage climate finance options in mobilising private sector operators for the project.

The CTF funds will be drawn from the Dedicated Private Sector Programme III designed to provide risk-appropriate financing for high-impact, large-scale private sector projects in clean technologies.

Alexander Richter 10 Jul 2017

EU funding of $8.6 million provided by the French Development Agency (AFD) is to drill additional deep wells for the Tendaho geothermal power project in Ethiopia.

As part of an overall project budget of EUR36.1 million for the Tendaho geothermal project in Ethiopia has been supported through the EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund with EUR 7.5 million ($8 million) in 2014, in form of technical assistance and investment grants. Now the project has secured additional funding of EUR 8 million ($8.6 million) for the project from the French Development Agency, Agence Française de Développement (AFD) (AFD).

This additional contribution approved in March 2017 shall be used for exploitation of deep reservoir including the drilling of additional deep wells. The EU-AITF contribution has been structured as an instrument rewarding success, meaning that the grant shall be reimbursed under certain conditions in case the project proves successful.

The main objective of the Tendaho project is to support the economic development of Ethiopia through the development of geothermal, a clean and reliable renewable energy resource therefore enhancing Ethiopian resilience to climate change.

For the Tendaho field, the Government of Ethiopia has set two targets:

The delineation and initial development of the shallow reservoir allowing in the short term exploitation of the shallow resource at the maximum sustainable capacity, presently estimated to be at least 10 MW;

The exploration of the deep reservoir by the initial drilling of deep exploration wells. The GoE target is the development in the medium terms of at least 100 MW of generation capacity.

Therefore, the Tendaho geothermal development Project – Phase 1 – has the following three specific objectives:

The definition of the extnesion of the shallow reservoir by the drilling of up to 6 step-out wells;

The exploration of the deep reservoir by the initial drilling of deep directional wells to a depth of 2500m;

Strengthening of EEP and GSE capacities for implementation of geothermal drilling activities.

It is intended that Phase 1 will be co-financed by EU-ITF and AFD through a soft loan. After successful completion of the first production drilling and finalization of the relevant feasibility studies, a Phase 2 will consist in the construction of approximately 10 MW of generation capacities. This phase 2 will be financed by AFD loan.

The ITF Investment Grant will be disbursed together with a loan from the AFD, as lead financier, and will support the rehabilitation of the Kremco rig and the drilling activities. The ITF technical assistance component will be used to complement the joint implementation unit staff and train them for drilling purposes.

Corbetti Geothermal is seeking to fill the position of Drilling Operations Manager for its geothermal project at Corbetti, Ethiopia.

Geothermal developer Corbetti Geothermal has published a job vacancy for a Drilling Operations Manager, reporting to the Project Director and the Director of Construction for the Corbetti Geothermal Project with location in Addis Ababa.

Project Background

Corbetti Geothermal Plc (CGC) is developing a geothermal power project (the Project) in Central Ethiopia near Lake Hawassa with a resource potential and contracted off-take for up to 520 MW. The Project has the potential to be one of the largest geothermal projects in Africa and is the first of its kind independent power project (IPP) in Ethiopia. A 25-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Ethiopian Electric Power (EEP) and an Implementation Agreement (IA) with the Government of Ethiopia (GoE) were signed on 19 December 2018 and the IA is in the process of being ratified by the Ethiopian Parliament.

The Project is planned to be implemented in phases. Phase I is a “proof of concept”, all equity, project supported by 3 to 5 geothermal wells with an electrical generating capacity of 10 MW using wellhead generators. Phase II is planned to be 50 MW; will be incorporated with Phase I; and will be financed substantially using limited recourse senior debt. Successful completion of the initial two phases will create a foundation for expanding the Project to 500 MW in multiple additional phases with a total estimated cost of at least $2 billion. Separate debt and equity fundraising will be required for each phase.

The debt associated with financing is expected to come from international Development Finance Institutions (“DFIs”). The philosophy of CGC shareholders, CGC management and the DFIs dictate that the Project must comply with the highest standards of technical, environmental, social, health and safety.

CGC is owned by Corbetti Holdco, (Holdco) a Mauritius company. The majority shareholder of Holdco is an investment vehicle called Rift Valley Geothermal Holdco (RVGH) which is owned by the African Renewable Energy Fund (AREF) under the management of Berkeley Energy (BE) and Infraco Africa Limited (Infraco).

The Chairman stated that the power plant is gas fired cogeneration plant and the capacity will be 500mv, which will be one hundred per cent self-financed by Turkish Industry Holding and its co-partner AKSA Energy, another giant company in the energy sector.

This is also part of a discussion with the Ethiopian government in the last six months. Turkish Industry Holding is now on its third visit to Ethiopia. The chairman of the holding company Mr. Mehmet Coskun said that they have decided to invest in Ethiopia following the discussion with President Mulatu Teshome, PhD, at the National Palace in their last two visits April 2018.

The company plans to invest 750 million Euros which will enable it to have its own Industrial Zone in Mekelle city of Addigudam region. This is as part of the government’s ambitious plan to increase the number of industrial zones in the country.

“We have full confidence and support of the authorities which encouraged us to further expand our investment not only in the heavy industry but also in the energy sector”, Mr. Mehmet said.

Turkish holding’s total investment in its own industrial zone in Mekelle region is planned to be established on over 484ha of land, employing 2800 people.

The first phase of this private industrial zone shall consist of four main factories second and third phase to follow after the completion and fully operational of the first phase.

In total, the zone shall consist of three phases and will accommodate 11 factories.

Hence, the industrial park itself shall use 135mw of the energy it will produce. When completed, the surplus will be provided to the government, for local consumption or for export market.

“We are very grateful to his Excellency the President Mulatu who supported this investment from the very beginning. My deepest gratitude to his Excellency Seleshi Bekele, PhD, Minister of MoWIE for his warm welcoming in his office this afternoon and for his full support detail information regarding the electricity production and supply procedures in Ethiopia”, Mr. Mehmet further stated.

“He also advised us to send our technical team to work together with his stuff in a shortest possible time to work on this project”.

Mekuria Lemma, Strategy and Investment Director with the Ethiopian Electric Power, told The Reporter that Corbetti Geothermal and the Ethiopian Electric Power (EEP) have agreed on all the pending issues on the power purchasing agreement. Though the implementation agreement was supposed to be signed in August 2016 it was delayed because of some differences that arose between the company and the government. Mekuria told The Reporter that the two parties have resolved their differences and hope to finalise the negotiation in September and sign the project implementation agreement by end of 2017. “We will have final round of meeting in September and sign the implementation agreement in October or November this year,” Mekuria said.

Reykjavik Geothermal (RG), an Icelandic company specialized in geothermal energy development projects, signed a framework agreement called “Heads of Terms” with the then Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation in October 2013 enabling it to develop 1000 MW of electricity from geothermal energy sources in Corbetti, Tulu Moye and Abaya localities in East Arsi Zone. Reykjavik Geothermal with its local partner Rift Valley Geothermal established Corbetti Geothermal Plc. and brought along two major investors–Berkley Energy and Iceland Drilling–who have shown a keen interest to invest on the geothermal development project.

RG split the 1000 MW geothermal development project into two phases–the 500MW Corbetti project and the 500MW Tulu Moye and Abaya project–each costing two billion dollars. Corbetti Geothermal Plc., a special purpose vehicle company established by RG in Ethiopia, has been working on the Corbetti geothermal development project located 270 km south-east of Addis Ababa in East Arsi Zone, Shalla Woreda, Corbetti Kebele. RG owns a 28.5 percent stake on Corbetti Geothermal Plc, Berkley Energy 53.5 percent and Iceland Drilling 18 percent. Corbetti Geothermal secured funding from major international financiers, including African Development Bank and European Investment Bank. Other many public and private investors from the US, the UK and other European countries are behind the Corbetti geothermal project. The project is also backed by the US Power Africa Initiative.

After a long negotiation, Corbetti Geothermal and the EEP signed a conditional power purchasing agreement in July 2015 during former US president Barack Obama visit to Addis Ababa. The company agreed to build the geothermal power plant and sell electric power for 7.53 US cents per KWh for the national grid.

Mekurai said since it was the first Power Purchasing Agreement (PPA) the EEP did not have the technical capability to negotiate with the international energy firm that came up with legal experts who have wealth of experience in similar power deals. Thus, EEP hired international legal consulting firm with a grant secured from the African Development Bank.

Corbetti Geothermal was waiting to sign the implementation agreement and proceed with the investment project. But the negotiation got into a stalemate when the Ethiopian Parliament enacted a new geothermal development law.

“We started the negotiation three years ago and signed the “Heads of Terms” when the country did not have a geothermal development law,” Mekuria told The Reporter. After looking at the geothermal proclamation, the Council of Ministers instructed MoWIE to reconcile the agreement with the new geothermal law. That was when the problem occurred.

Mekuria said they identified eight points that contradicts with the new geothermal law. The new geothermal law limits the concession area for geothermal development to 200 hectares of land while Corbetti Geothermal’s license area covers 700 hectares of land. “With 200 hectares of land they can generate only 100 MW. But Corbetti targets to generate 500 MW.”

Tax issue was another bone of contention. Initially RG secured the exploration license from the then Ministry of Mines which used to administer the geothermal sector. Back then the mining law levied 25 percent profit tax on geothermal energy generation. But later on, the geothermal sector was transferred to MoWIE that levies 30 percent tax on geothermal development.

The “Heads of Terms” was signed on build own and operate basis while the new geothermal law stipulates that the developer will operate the power plant for 25 years and will transfer the plant to the Ethiopian government. “We had to change that to build, operate and transfer basis. We really pushed the company hard to accept these points,” Mekuria told The Reporter.

Mekuria said Corbetti Geothermal demanded the government to consider two percent cost escalation on the investment project since 2014. “The government refused that and agreed to consider the cost escalation beginning 2016. All these points had to be dealt with. It was a tough negotiation and it took a long time. They accepted most of our proposals and we conceded to some of their demands.”

State minister of the MoWIE, Wondimu Tekle, told The Reporter that one of the disagreements was on the ownership of the natural resources that may be discovered during drilling the geothermal wells. Wondimu said Corbetti Geothermal claims that it is entitled to make use of any mineral resource that could be discovered during drilling the geothermal wells while the government has a firm stance that any associated mineral belongs to the state. “Gold or petroleum could be discovered and that should be owned by the government. That was one of our differences. But finally the company accepted our position.”

The Corbetti Geothermal Project, pronounced as the biggest geothermal development project in Africa was announced during the UN General Assembly in New York in 2013 with a splash international media coverage.

Mekuria said that Corbetti geothermal has gone a long way and invested a huge sum of money on the pre-development work. “They have spent more than 30 million dollars on the exploration project. They started negotiations with us three years ago but they have been working on the project for the past seven years,” Mekuria told The Reporter.

“Before we sign the final agreement, we have spent on the project in good faith because we trust the Ethiopian government,” senior executive of the Corbetti Geothermal told The Reporter. “We have built access road to the drilling site. We have also been engaged in community development projects,” the executive said. “Today we are happy that after marathon negotiations we are about to sign the implementation agreement. This clean energy development project has multi-faceted benefits to Ethiopia. The global energy industry is closely watching it to happen. If it succeeds other geothermal developers will follow suit,” he added.

Mekuria said that the implementation agreement will be ratified by the Parliament and the agreement would be signed with Corbetti Geothermal end of this year. “The company is already in the process of procuring drilling service.”

According to Mekuria, once the implementation agreement for the Corbetti geothermal project is signed negotiation for Tulu Moye and Abaya geothermal development project would commence. Mekuria said RG is also committed to start work on Tulu Moye and Abaya project-which will have an installed generation capacity of another 500MW. RG considers Tulu Moye and Abaya as second phase project that will kick off once PPA and IA are signed.

Mekuria said RG has notified EEP and its partner, an American company called Meridian, which will finance the Tulu Moye and Abaya geothermal project.

According to Mekuria, as Ethiopia transitions to industrialization it requires more reliable energy sources. “As we are developing the manufacturing sector and building industrial parks our demand for electric power increases. Accordingly, we have to develop reliable and sustainable energy sources. Geothermal should be our base plant. A geothermal power plant generates constantly for more than 20 hours while hydro power plant generation depends on the amount of water stored in the dam. A 100 MW geothermal power plant is equivalent to 200 MW hydro power plant. Some countries which do not have geothermal resources use nuclear, coal or gas power plants as base plants. But we have the geothermal resource-a clean energy source. So we should focus on that.”

The country’s total generation capacity has reached 4,280 MW of which the lion share 92 percent is hydro, six percent is wind and other two percent thermal. Ethiopia’s geothermal potential is estimated at its maximum to be 10,000MW while the hydro power potential generation capacity is as high as 45,000 MW."	https://www.thereporterethiopia.com/content/corbetti-geothermal-take
Active	"The contract, worth up to $8 million, was signed by the African Union (AU) and the Icelandic-US private developer Reykjavik Geothermal Limited (RG) for drilling the wells at the Corbetti geothermal power project.

The grant was awarded under the AU-led ‘geothermal risk mitigation facility’, which is designed to encourage public private investment and financial support for geothermal exploration in East Africa. The grant was approved at an international donor meeting in Iceland last week hosted by the AU Commission and the International Development Bank.

Under an agreement with Ethiopia’s government, RG is building southern Ethiopia's Corbetti facility in two phases (4-page / 1 MB PDF). The first phase, at a cost of $2 billion, is result in an initial 500 megawatts-electric (MWe) of power being brought on line within five years, followed by a further 500 MWe from the second phase in eight years.

According to RG, the total cost of the project is $4bn, assuming 25% equity financing and debt financing of 75%.

When complete, RG said the project will represent the largest foreign direct investment in Ethiopia. The company has acquired geothermal exploration licences covering an area of more than 6,500 square kilometres (sq km) in the so-called Southern Lakes District of the Central Main Ethiopian Rift. Within that area, RG said its scientists have “pinpointed an area of 200 sq km in which high temperatures up to 350C (662F) have been identified, indicating a potential of 500-1,000 MWe”.

The project plans to utilise geothermal energy from three different resources at Corbetti, Tulu Moyer and Abaya.

Exploration drilling had initially been scheduled to start in the first quarter of 2014 and to last for up to eight months. Production drilling and construction of the first phase is scheduled to start after financial closing in the first quarter of 2015, RG said.

RG said negotiations are under way with the state-owned Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation for a ‘25-year-plus’ power purchase agreement. “The Corbetti concession is in a densely-populated area with good road access and at the heart of the national electric grid,” RG said.

Initial studies and field work for the project were completed by the end of October 2013. RG said: “Ethiopia has a rapidly growing economy... The shortfall in the power sector has been identified as a major impediment to the continued growth of Ethiopia. The untapped geothermal resources of Ethiopia are plentiful and accessible. Developers can quickly improve indigenous infrastructures and boost local economies while utilising environmentally sound best practices and technologies. The project ties with Ethiopia’s ambitious plans to become a carbon-neutral economy by 2025.”

In 2013, Norway agreed to provide Ethiopia with $13m, through the World Bank’s BioCarbon Fund, to help the country’s carbon neutrality programme.

International Monetary Fund managing director Christine Lagarde said last week that the “scaling up” of energy infrastructure investments in Ethiopia and other African nations were “critical for growth to be sustained”."	https://www.pinsentmasons.com/out-law/news/ethiopian-power-project-wins-backing-from-geothermal-fund

Active	"Tullu Moye Geothermal Operations Private Limited Company has embarked on the development a 520 MW geothermal project in the Oromia Regional State with an outlay of two billion dollars.

The Tulu Moye Geothermal project is located in the Oromia Regional State, East Arsi zone, near Eteya town. Tulu Moye Geothermal Operations plans to develop 520 MW of electricity in four phases. Reykjavik Geothermal (RG), an Icelandic company, and Meridiam, a US firm, are shareholders of Tullu Moye Geothermal Operations.

The power purchasing agreement (PPA) was signed by the Ethiopian Electric Power (EEP) and the Ministry of Finance and Economic Cooperation along with Corbetti Geothermal project on December 2017. The two geothermal projects, the first independent power producers in Ethiopia, would have an installed capacity of generating 1,000 MW. The total investment costs are estimated to be four billion dollars.

The CEO of TM Geothermal Operations Private Limited Company, Darrell Boyd, told The Reporter that his company has embarked on the new geothermal project. “In many ways we have started the project. We have done environmental and social studies. We have been making assessment for the past couple of years. Geothermal studies have been going on for many years. In terms of real investment in the project area will begin in October,” Boyd said.

According to Boyd the company is closely working with the local kebele and woreda administrations on the preparation work. According to the CEO, the company has to build access road and drill water wells. Engineering work is expected to commence in October.

Tullu Moye agreed to sell the power it will generate from the geothermal power plant to EEP. Power tariff has always been a challenge in Ethiopia as the state power monopoly charges the public minimal rates. “The power tariff is competitive. It is a challenge. We will have to do things on time in a very efficient manner. We have to procure things well. We have to deliver returns to our shareholders and investors,” Boyd said.

With regards to peace and stability Boyd said that there are no security concerns in the area. “When I first came to Ethiopia after twenty years people told me that it is not safe, we need permission to travel to the project area etc. But in the last four months there are no such concerns and restrictions. We have a better access in the past couple of months.”

Tullu Moye Geothermal Operations will invest two billion dollars over eight years’ development and construction period. The project will be undertaken in four phases. The first phase with 50 MW installed capacity will cost USD 250 million. “We have to rich financial close by the end of next year. Initial wells will be drilled, prove the resource viability and sustainability. After confirming the commercial viability and sustainability commencement of delivery for phase1 for the first 50 MW will be by the end of 2021,” Boyd told The Reporter.

The US government hailed the Tullu Moye geothermal project. The US Trade and Development Agency has awarded Tullu Moye Geothermal Operations Plc a grant of USD 1.1 million to coordinate a feasibility study supporting development of the first 50 MW of a planned 520 MW project in Ethiopian main rift valley. The agreement was signed on August 27 by CEO of TM Geothermal Operations Private Limited Company Darrell Boyd and Katrien Hinderdael, USTDA country manager for East African at the Sheraton Addis. On the occasion Troy D. Fitrell, chargé d'affaires of the US Embassy, stated that there is no way to develop Ethiopia without having access to electricity. “It has to be sustainable, reliable and affordable. Ethiopia is blessed with geothermal, hydro, solar and wind resources. There is no success for Ethiopia in the future without accessing these resources,” Fitrell said. He said geothermal is a reliable, sustainable and affordable energy resource. “It is cheaper than other most alternative energy sources.”

Darrell Boyd who acknowledged the US government’s support to Tullu Moye geothermal project said that the project will help Ethiopia unlock its geothermal potential. With the potential to generate 10,000MW of electricity Ethiopia is one of the leading countries with geothermal resources in the region.

The guest of honor, Frehiwot Woldehanna (PhD), state minister of Water, Irrigation and Electric stated that geothermal is the major untapped energy resource next to hydro. “We have not been able to exploit this natural energy resource. As geothermal exploration work is very expensive the USTDA support is significant. This kind of support facilitates the quick development of the sector,” Frehiwot said. “We are very grateful for the line of support that we are getting from the US government.”

Frehiwot said since there is a huge untapped geothermal resources in the rift valley two companies may not be enough the exploit the resources adding that the government expects more independent power producers to come and unlock the potential. According to him, the power projects are awarded through open international tenders.

Katrien Hinderdael, country manager for East African USTDA, said that the Ethiopian government has shown a keen interest to develop renewable energy resources. “We want to see projects where there is a business opportunity for American companies. We are looking at power sector energy, transportation and ICT open for business proposals. We always look for opportunity to support companies. There is so much business opportunity in the Ethiopian market,” Hiderdael said.

The pioneer IPP projects in Ethiopia, Corbetti and Tullu Moye, are supported by USTDA and Power Africa. RG is the developer while Meridiam, Berkley Energy, and Africa Infrastructure are the investors in the projects. Ethiopian born Canadian, Nejib Abbabiya, is the initiator of these projects through his company, Rift Valley Geothermal.

African Development Bank backs study into Tanzania hydropower and dam project

Posted on : Friday , 12th August 2016



The African Development Bank (AfDB) said the grant being made available to Tanzania’s government is in principle to study the potential for building a 300-megawatt hydro generating facility on the river Ruhuhu in Kikonge, in the southwest of the country.

If developed, the facility is expected to boost domestic electricity production in Tanzania by 53%, culminating in 1,300 gigawatt hours of production by 2025, said the AfDB, which manages the AWF on behalf of the African Ministers’ Council on Water.

The AWF grant is for €2m with additional contributions from the Climate Resilient Infrastructure Development Facility (€0.3m) and Tanzania’s government (€0.2m). The estimated duration of the project is 22 months.

The AfDB said: “The country’s hydropower plants of the run-of-the-river type are highly vulnerable to seasonal variations and drastic variations of water availability as a consequence of climate change.”

According to the AfDB, the study will include proposals to build a dam with a capacity of six billion cubic metres “to allow a stable supply of energy throughout the year”.

The multi-purpose facility will help to combat severe energy shortages in Tanzania, the AfDB said. “In October 2015, most of the hydropower plants, representing 35% of the country’s total generating capacity, were switched off due to the low water levels following an extended period without rain.”

The dam “will also improve availability of water resources for irrigation and associated activities in the area”, the AfDB said. “Regulating the flow of the Ruhuhu will allow water to be available throughout the year instead of depending on the rain season inflows. It will also reduce the impacts and damages of floods on infrastructures and economic activities, with positive impacts on the ecological features of the shores of Lake Nyasa.”

Tanzania has an increasing need to boost domestic electricity production. Last year, the Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa (Sefa) approved a preparation grant for the development of a number of “solar-hybrid mini grids” in rural growth centres in Tanzania.

Sefa is a multi-donor facility designed to unlock private investments in small to medium-sized clean energy projects in Africa. The fund is endowed with $60m from the governments of Denmark and the US. The $420,000 Sefa grant for Tanzania was awarded to Jumeme Rural Power Supply Ltd – a joint venture company formed by German energy supply systems firm Inensus GmbH, Austria-based renewable energy project developer TerraProjects and Tanzania’s St Augustine University in Mwanza.

The World Bank has said the impact of climate change on Africa’s water and energy infrastructure “will be costly” and that immediate action is needed to reduce risks to future planning and investment. In a report published last year, ‘Enhancing the Climate Resilience of Africa’s Infrastructure’ (192-page / 9.21 MB PDF), the bank said a “climate resilience project preparation facility” should be established to support plans for infrastructure investment, in addition to training programmes for planners and designers.

The bank’s International Finance Corporation (IFC) is backing a wind farm project in central Tanzania’s Singida province, around 700 kilometres from Dar es Salaam, which it said will be “a blueprint to wind developers eyeing Tanzania”.

According to the IFC the Singida project will increase Tanzania's installed generating capacity by 100 MW. The facility, which will cost a total $285m to develop, is expected to start operating by December 2017 and provide “a stable and inexpensive source of power”.

In the 2012 update of the Tanzania Power Master Plan, the government said it wanted to see 250,000 new connections to the grid annually from 2013 to 2017.

According to the International Monetary Fund (51-page / 1.03 MB PDF), Tanzania also has “good prospects” over the next decade of becoming a major producer and exporter of natural gas.

The agreement was signed at the end of a three-day Joint Permanent Commission Summit held in Kampala, which was led by Tanzania’s foreign minister Augustine Mahiga and Uganda’s minister of energy Irene Muloni.

According to the EastAfrican, the deal is a culmination of work that began during the first Tanzania-Uganda meeting held in April 2017, in which the two countries agreed on a number of memoranda and co-operation frameworks.

This will be the first trans-border gas pipeline in East Africa since the extraction of natural gas commenced in 2004 at the Songosongo Island in Tanzania’s southern region of Lindi.

Carrying natural gas to Uganda

Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC) managing director Kapuulya Musomba told The EastAfrican that he is confident the pipeline construction will be successful given the expertise and experience gained through the construction and servicing of two pipelines – the 532km Mtwara-Dar es Salaam one and the crude oil pipeline that is underway.

Musomba said apart from carrying natural gas to Uganda, the pipeline will distribute the product along the route. Read more: Regional development bank commits to Tanzania’s gas power plant

Dar es Salaam. The 2115MW Julius Nyerere Hydropower Project will gobble 65.54 per cent of the total budget for the ministry of energy in the 2020/21 fiscal year, according to the docket minister, Dr Medard Kalemani.

The amount allocated for the construction of the dam commonly referred to as ‘Stiegler’s gorge’ is also equivalent to 66.4 per cent of the ministry’s development budget, according to the ministry’s budget plan presented to Parliament yesterday.

It will be the second consecutive financial year for the dam project to be the main key expenditure focus for the ministry, with the government raising its allocation by nearly 10 per cent this year.

In the 2019/2020 fiscal plan, the ministry set aside Sh1.22 trillion or 56.9 per cent of the total budget for the initial plans to construct the dam.

The ministry’s budget was Sh2.142 trillion that year.

Yesterday, Dr Kaleman said the whole allocation to the project had been disbursed by April 2020.

President John Magufuli has made the dam one of his signature infrastructure projects even though it had not been originally listed under the country’s Five Year Development Plan II.

The head of State considers the project a legacy to honour Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, the founding president of Tanzania and assure energy self sufficiency.

The construction of the dam project has been in the card for decades but received opposition, especially in the international circles over environmental concerns as well as the reported high cost of establishment when compared to green energy alternatives.

In Parliament Dr Kalemani requested for approval of Sh2.197 trillion, a 2.5 per cent rise over last year’s budget.Sh2.168 trillion of the total budget has been set aside for development projects, meaning after the dam, the remainder of Sh728 billion will be shared among other projects.

“Activities that will be implemented by the dam project during this financial year include building the main dam and spill-ways, construction of tunnels, erection of an area for installation of a power house and as well as structuring a place for the switch center,” the minister told the parliament.

He said this year’s allocation for the project was Sh221 billion more. According to the minister, the project on Rufiji Basin in Coast Region has employed 3,897 people.

Tax payers will shoulder Sh1.968 trillion of the dam’s bill for the year while Sh200.75 billion will be externally sourced.

The ministry will spend Sh28.4 billion for recurrent expenditure, including Sh13.374 billion for payment of salaries and Sh15.03 billion for other Charges (OC).

He named other power generation projects that will be implemented this fiscal year and respective allocations as Ruhudji power project (Sh255.58bn/558MW), extension of the 185MW Kinyerezi I project (Sh138bn) and the 222MW Ramakali project (Sh23bn).

Other projects are the 87MW Kakono project (Sh1.56bn), 300MW Kikonge project (1.04BN), 300MW project in Mtwara (Sh500M), 45MW Malagarasi project (Sh100m), the 80MW Rusumo (Sh13.8m) and several solar and coal power generation projects.

According to Dr Kalemani, other project would involve implementation of 400kV pow-er transmission projects from Singida, Arusha to Namanga (Sh30.2bn) and 220kV from Geita to Nyakanazi (Sh25.3bn).

The implementation of the second phase project to con-struct 400 kV power transmission line from Nyakanazi to Kigoma (Sh34.3bn), the 400 kV project from the Julius Nyerere Center –Chalinze-Dodoma (Sh8.4bn), the kV 400 line from Chalinze to Kinyerezi (Sh3.89bn).

“During the said financial year, Sh5bn has been allocated for the project to connect Kigo-ma Region to the national grid through Tabora Region.

Also, the 400 kV transmission line from Iringa-Mbeya-Tunduma to Sumbawanga will be constructed,” he said.

Dr Kalemani said the country’s power generation capacity has reached 1,601.84MW out of which 1,565.72 is injected directly to the national grid.

According to him, 573.7MW is generated from water, 892.72 is produced from natural gas, 88.80 from crude oil, 10.50MW from biomass.

He said the Tanzania Electric Supply Company (Tanesco) generate 36.12MW which is, however, not connected in the national grid.

The Energy and Minerals Committee chairman, Mr Dunstan Kitandula, called on for the government to ensure funds for implementation of the JNHPP is disbursed on time.

“Supervision for implementation of the project should also be increased because the project has reached an important stage of implementation,” he said.

Also, he called on the government to ensure the country had enough fuel reserve following unpredictability of the global fuel business and possibility of serious economic recession that will be caused of the Covid-19 pandemic.

According to him, the government should also reflect on the best way of implementing the Rural Energy (REA) projects that depend on fuel levy as among important sources of funds."	https://www.thecitizen.co.tz/news/Nyerere-dam-to-take-66-per-cent-of-energy-budget/1840340-5547042-4ywthp/index.html

The 80MW project is expected to be complete by 2020, according to the council of ministers from the three countries.

Amb. Claver Gatete, Rwanda’s minister for infrastructure, told the media that: “We want to assure the public that the deadline set will be met.”

Once the project is complete, the minister said, it will boost Rwanda’s access to electricity by 4 per cent as 467,000 households will be connected to the national grid.

Electricity access in Rwanda stands at 46 per cent with plans to achieve universal access by 2024.

The project will boost Burundi’s access to electricity by 5 per cent and 0.34 per cent for Tanzania.

It’s jointly funded by the World Bank and the African Development Bank to a tune of $468 million.

The project is also being implemented alongside two other small programmes— the local area development and the livelihood restoration programme—which were designed to cater for the resettlement of people who were relocated from their land in order to pave way for the implementation of the energy project.

ARUSHA, Tanzania, April 23 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian government on Tuesday unveiled plans to expand its current power generation capacity by 2025 through investment in thermal and renewable energy.

Subira Mgalu, Tanzania's deputy energy minister told parliament in the country's capital Dodoma that the move is part of the government's mission to act on investors' queries over lack of reliable power, which hurts business in the east African nation.

""Implementation of various power generation projects will increase the capacity of our national power grid from 1,602 megawatts (MW) presently to 10,000 megawatts by 2025,"" Mgalu said.

Tanzania has said it plans to export surplus electricity to energy-starved nations in eastern and southern Africa once it has boosted its generation capacity.

""We need to have abundant and reliable power from an energy mix that includes hydropower, natural gas, solar and wind,"" Mgalu said, when responding to a question by the Special Seats MP Zainab Katimba.

The minister named some of the projects to increase power production as the expansion of the Kinyerezi I natural gas power plant from 150 MW to 335 MW whose implementation is expected to be done by August, this year.

Other projects include the KInyerezi II 240 MW which had been completed in April last year, and Mtwara MW 300 power project under the sponsorship of the Japan International Cooperation Agency which is expected to be done by March next year.

Moreover, she said, December 2018, the government started implementation of the 2,115 MW Rufiji Hydro-Power project as well as 80 MW Rusumo project.

To meet the 10,000 MW targets by 2015, the Deputy Minister said they have inline Kishapu 150 MW, Singida 100 MW windmill and Coal power project of 600 MW."	http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-04/24/c_138002608.htm
Active	"The Songwe River is at the centre of attention in Malawi and Tanzania. Both countries want to develop the basin of this watercourse as a natural boundary. To this end, a joint commission was recently launched in Kyela District, Mbeya region (Tanzania) by Joseph Mwanamvekha, Malawi’s Minister of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water, and Jumaa Aweso, Tanzania’s Deputy Minister of Water and Irrigation. The body aims to facilitate investment in development projects around the Songwe River.

The 472 km long Songwe River originates in Poroto-Berge, Tanzania, zigzags between the two borders before flowing into Lake Malawi. “The objective of the commission is to supervise the management of the river basin resources for the benefit of the populations of the two neighbouring countries,” according to the Tanzanian and Malawian authorities.

Expected hydraulic projects!

The new commission is being formed as the two countries are already working together on the 180 MW Songwe hydroelectric project. The dam and power plant will be located south of the town of Itumba, 120 km from Mbeya. The feasibility study of the project, financed by the African Development Bank (AfDB), has been carried out since 2015. The Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) has also been completed since 2017.

The project requires a $829 million investment to complete. Tanzania and Malawi, seeking financing, have already obtained the AfDB’s agreement to invest in this project. The energy produced will be equally divided (90 MW) between Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited (Tanesco) and Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation Limited, the two companies that provide public electricity services in the two respective countries.

In addition to this hydroelectric project, the Tanzania-Malawi Joint Commission on Songwe River Basin Management is developing an irrigation project. The initiative covers 6,000 hectares of plantations on both sides of the border. Irrigation water will be pumped from the Songwe Dam.

In East Africa, the joint initiative of countries for the development of watercourses is an attractive practice. This is evidenced by the recent collaboration between Zimbabwe and Zambia in the construction of the Batoka Gorge Dam on the Zambezi River. The project is led by the Zambezi River Authority (ZRA), an organisation owned by both states. The future Batoka Gorge hydroelectric power plant will provide 2,400 MW divided equally between Zimbabwe and Zambia.

The Baihetan hydroelectric facility is expected to generate 60 billion kilowatt hours (KWh) of electricity, while offsetting 52 million tonnes (Mt) of CO 2 emissions a year.

Baihetan hydropower project background

Baihetan is one of the four Chinese hydropower projects either in operation or under development with an installed capacity of more than 10GW. The four projects, all located on the Jinsha River, will have a combined installed capacity of approximately 46GW and an annual generation capacity of 190TWh.

The other three mega hydroelectric projects apart from Baihetan are the 22.5GW Three Gorges Dam (operational) on the Yangtze River, the 13.86GW Xiluodu hydropower station (operational), and the 10.2GW Wudong­de hydropower station (under construction) on the Jinsha River.

The Baihetan and Wudong­de projects are envisioned under the Go-West Program of China, which is aimed at transferring electricity from west to east China.

The Baihetan project is located downstream of the Wudon­gde hydropower project. The Xiluodu and the 6.4GW Xiangjiaba hydroelectric projects located downstream of the Baihetan project have been operational since 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Baihetan hydropower project development details

The feasibility study for the project was approved by the National Development and Reform Commission of China in 2010. Construction works on the project were started in August 2017 and the first turbine unit was installed in January 2019.

The power station is expected to start generating electricity by 2021 and reach full operational capacity by 2022.

Baihetan hydroelectric facility make-up

The Baihetan project includes the construction of a concrete double-curvature arch dam with a maximum dam height of 289m. The dam crest elevation is 834m and centre line arc length is 709m.

The project will have two underground powerhouses, one each on the left and right banks of the dam. Each powerhouse will be equipped with eight 1,000MW Francis turbines to be indigenously manufactured in China.

Baihetan dam and reservoir details

The impoundment level of the dam is 825m, while the reservoir capacity will be 20.627bn m³. The dam is designed to have a regulation storage capacity of 10.43 billion cubic meters (bcm) and flood control storage capacity of 7.5bcm.

The Baihetan dam will have six flood gate structures and three spillway tunnels. The flood discharge capacity of the project will be 42,346m³/s.

Active	"An oft-repeated refrain—the sun doesn’t always shine, and the wind doesn’t always blow—is sometimes seen as an impediment to renewable energy. But it’s also an impetus toward discovering the best ways to store that energy until it’s needed.

Declining costs in available technologies have propelled interest in energy storage forward like never before. The price of lithium-ion batteries has fallen by about 80% over the past five years, enabling the integration of storage into solar power systems. Today, nearly 18% of all electricity produced in the United States comes from renewable energy sources, such as hydropower and wind—a figure that is forecast to climb. And as communities and entire states push toward higher percentages of power from renewables, there’s no doubt storage will play an important role.

Compared with the same period a year earlier, the United States saw a 93% increase in the amount of storage deployed in the third quarter of 2019. By 2024, that number is expected to top 5.4 gigawatts, according to a forecast by market research firm Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables. The market value is forecast to increase from $720 million today to $5.1 billion in 2024. Driving such growth is an increased focus on adding renewable energy sources to the nation’s grid.

Only in the past decade has the widespread adoption of renewable energy sources become an economic possibility, said Paul Denholm, a principal energy analyst at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). He joined NREL 15 years ago and, at the time, he and other analysts were busy plotting a path to 20% of the nation’s energy supply coming from renewable sources. Now, they’re aiming much higher.

“The declining cost of wind and solar and now batteries makes it conceivable to consider 100% renewables,” he said.

NREL’s Renewable Electricity Futures Study estimated that 120 gigawatts of storage would be needed across the continental United States by 2050, when the scenario imagined a future where 80% of electricity will come from renewable resources. The country currently has 22 gigawatts of storage from pumped hydropower, and another gigawatt in batteries.

Hawaii, which must import all of its fossil fuels and pays a high price for electricity as a result, is experimenting with using battery storage to meet its energy goals. The state is aiming for 100% clean energy by 2045, using both renewable energy and improved energy efficiency. The AES Corporation, based in Virginia, has installed the world’s largest solar-plus-storage system on the southern end of Kauai.

Solar panels capable of producing 28 megawatts of electricity were paired with 18,304 lithium-ion battery modules. The batteries are charged during the day and deliver energy in the early morning and evening when the solar panels aren’t generating electricity.

The system stores enough energy to meet electricity needs for four hours and eliminates the need for 3.7 million gallons of fuel annually, according to Kauai Island Utility Cooperative, which provides power to the island. Kauai now generates about 55% of its energy via photovoltaic (PV) systems.

NREL researchers tested how well this PV-storage system would work by installing and evaluating a scaled-down version at its Flatirons Campus.

“You can see simulations and you can see some graphs. It’s nothing as convincing as seeing a utility-size device operating,” said Przemek Koralewicz, principal investigator on the testing project. “This gives you a lot of confidence.”

A second AES PV-plus-storage plant now under construction at the Navy base on Kauai will provide electricity to customers as needed but also serve as an isolated microgrid for the military should power be interrupted. When the new plant becomes operational next year, about 60% of electricity on Kauai will come from renewables.

“These two plants from AES can supply half the power for the entire island,” Koralewicz said. “During the night, they can provide full power, in certain scenarios. That’s why it’s important to test it. AES doesn’t want it to be unstable or have problems.”

Battery storage provides a way to keep the grid stable, allowing an instant balance between supply and demand. Storage also is poised to replace conventional energy generation during peak demands, eliminating the need for additional plants, but limitations hamper the use of batteries. A power plant can remain operational for decades, but a battery must be replaced after about a dozen years. Batteries also suffer from a limited capacity, which means they typically only can store enough energy to provide power for four hours.

Cost of Storage Isn’t Easy to Quantify

Pinning down the cost of storage remains elusive. A frequently used metric called levelized cost of energy (LCOE) allows a comparison of the cost to generate electricity by different means. But the LCOE is only accurate when the differing technologies provide the same services.

A group of NREL researchers, including David Feldman and Robert Margolis, developed an LCOE for solar plus storage. “Like all LCOEs, it has its limitations in use,” Feldman said. “One of the challenges, particularly for storage, is that there are so many different use cases that cost doesn’t mean much unless you are defining the value that the system brings.”

Using storage can save a utility money by reducing the need to generate electricity and avoiding transmission costs.

An NREL-authored paper published last year in The Electricity Journal found solar-plus-storage reduced utility costs for commercial buildings in more than half of the 17 cities examined, in some cases by as much as 24%. Using batteries for storage, the properties were able to offset a utility’s rates that require users to pay more during times of peak demand.

Peaking power plants, fueled by natural gas and switched on to help meet peak demand, run into cost comparisons against batteries capable of storing four hours of energy. For that duration, the balance tips in favor of batteries. Beyond four hours, though, the battery becomes more expensive.

“The reason why we have so many peaking plants is air conditioning,” said Denholm. “That’s when we use the most electricity. One thing you can do is instead of building a bunch of power plants that only run 100 hours a year when it’s really hot, you can store cold energy in the form of ice or something. Make ice at 4 in the morning and then, when it gets hot in the middle of the afternoon, you can release that cold stored energy and cool down your house or your building.”

Technologies Encompass a Wide Range

“There’s a misunderstanding. Storage is often looked upon as electrochemical storage or battery storage,” said Adarsh Nagarajan, the group manager for Power System Design and Planning at NREL and who works extensively on integrating renewables onto the grid. “Storage is beyond batteries. It’s beyond electrochemical. It’s much broader.”

The Department of Energy (DOE) Global Energy Storage Database counts nearly 700 storage projects announced, operational, or under construction across the United States that rely on myriad technologies. In addition to batteries, the storage methods include ice, pumped hydropower, heat, chilled water, and electrochemical. Still other technologies are under development.

“There is no one winner,” Nagarajan said. “All of them should work together in order to achieve a certain goal, which is grid stability and resilience and to fulfill customer needs.”

But even with so many ways to store energy already available, new or improved technologies are constantly being proposed. Researchers at NREL developed a technique to inject natural gas into depleted wells, patented a method for storing pressurized hydrogen inside specially designed wind turbines, and improved the design of lithium-ion batteries to make them last longer.

Clear favorites have emerged among storage technologies already in use. The DOE Energy Storage Technology and Cost Characterization ReportPDF calculated that among battery technologies, lithium-ion batteries provide the best option for four-hour storage in terms of cost, performance, and maturity of the technology. For a longer span, pumped-storage hydropower and compressed-air energy storage are considered the best options. Between those two, pumped-storage hydro is the more mature technology and accounted for 98 percent of worldwide energy storage deployed in 2018.

Water Most Commonly Used in Storage

Pumped storage hydropower is the backbone of the nation’s storage capability. Historically, it was used to incorporate large, inflexible generation onto the power system. Currently, pumped storage is being used to help integrate large amounts of renewable energy onto the grid, serving as an enabling technology that both improves reliability and reduces costs. Pumped storage hydro relies on two reservoirs sited at different elevations. Electricity that’s been generated but not immediately needed is used to pump water from the lower reservoir to the upper one. When power is needed, the stored water is released to flow downhill and power a turbine.

“One of the real challenges hydro faces is that it can take eight to 10 years to get a plant built,” said Greg Stark, the hydropower technical manager at NREL as well as the laboratory’s waterpower grid integration lead. “Given all the uncertainty in the power markets, people are hesitant to invest in a 10-year project.”

To help address these time-to-market concerns, the DOE has instituted the FAST Commissioning Challenge. Tessa Greco, NREL’s new water power innovative projects manager, is leading the competition for the department’s Water Power Technologies Office, with the goal being to cut project execution time in half while also reducing the costs and risks associated with bringing pumped storage online. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has also recognized these challenges and has ordered that licensing decisions for closed-loop pumped storage projects be made within two years. So far, this type of system—which isn’t connected to an existing body of water and thereby reduces environmental concerns—has yet to be built in the United States.

Several projects are in process, including the Gordon Butte project in Montana. The Gordon Butte system, which has been permitted and is expected to begin construction this year, will use two man-made reservoirs and three turbines to provide 400 MW of capacity and 8.5 hours of storage. Pumped storage has historically required a unique design and build strategy for every new project; however, the Gordon Butte project presents a replicable model, which could save money for potential developers.

“Pumped storage really comes into its own when you need very large amounts of power for an extended period of time,” Stark said. “Part of that is because the incremental cost to increase the duration for pumped storage is just building a bigger reservoir. It’s still the same turbines and other infrastructure, whereas with battery storage for example, if you want longer duration, you have to buy more batteries.”

Seasonal Storage Requires Careful Study

Long-term energy storage is roughly defined as from 10–100 hours. Anything over that is considered seasonal. Wind blows more in the spring, so being able to capture that energy until it can be used when needed in the summer creates research opportunities. Hydrogen, hydropower, and compressed air are the most viable technologies for storing energy over lengthy periods, according to Omar Guerra and Josh Eichman, researchers at NREL studying the value of seasonal energy storage technologies.

Working in partnership with Southern California Gas Company, NREL installed a bioreactor to test power-to-gas technology as a way to store renewable energy. The project, a first in the United States, relies on microorganisms that convert hydrogen and carbon dioxide into methane. The methane can be stored in the company’s pipeline for use later.

The network of natural gas pipelines across the United States runs for about 3 million miles and already is used as a storage vehicle. “It’s moving the gas, but it’s also a way to store it,” said Keith Wipke, manager of NREL’s Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Technologies program.

Hydrogen can be added to the natural gas pipeline—as much as about 10%—or stored separately. One method to store hydrogen that’s been proposed—but has yet to be widely adopted—is carving out space within salt caverns, Wipke said.

Storing natural gas helps hedge against price fluctuations and meet seasonal demands, but the cost of the equipment has stalled the adoption of seasonal electricity storage. Hydrogen storage remains an emerging technology, but as research leads to improvements it’s expected to eventually be the most cost-effective method for keeping and discharging at least a week’s worth of electricity, Guerra said. Pumped hydropower and compressed air storage of as long as two days are forecast to be cost-competitive with generating new electricity.

“Pumped hydro and compressed-air energy storage are well-developed technologies, so we don’t expect a significant decline in those capital costs,” Guerra said. “Those costs also may depend on the location. In some places you may have an opportunity to develop pumped hydro in a cost-effective way. In other places you may have the opportunity for compressed-air energy storage.”

“We need to drive the cost down on the technologies we have today, and certainly some new technologies that are better and cheaper would be good,” Wipke said.

Zhiwen Ma is working on just that. The researcher works in NREL’s Thermal Systems Group and focuses his efforts on concentrating solar power, or CSP. The technology uses a series of mirrors or lenses to concentrate sunlight onto a small area, and the energy captured can be stored in molten salt. But the salts are corrosive, so research is ongoing to the ideal containment vessel. Instead of salt, Ma is using sand to store the heat.

DOE’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, which funds futuristic ideas, has awarded NREL $2.8 million to investigate the feasibility of Ma’s low-cost thermal energy storage system. When needed, the heated sand will heat a fluid that drives a gas turbine attached to a generator.

“The main advantages over molten salt are the low cost and performance,” Ma said. The sand is a fraction of the cost of the salt but can be heated to 1,200 degrees Centigrade compared to 600 degrees for nitrate salt or 800 degrees for chloride salt.

With so many options to store energy, researchers are determined to find the best methods. After all, the sun doesn’t always shine, and the wind doesn’t always blow.

Active	"The 2,400MW Ituango hydroelectric project will be the largest hydropower plant in Colombia. The plant is being built on the banks of Cauca River, eight kilometres downstream of the Pescadero road bridge. The project is located in the northwestern region of Antioquia, about 170km north of the Colombian city of Medellin.

The project is a part of the initiative undertaken to exploit the hydroelectric potential of the Cauca River in its middle stretch. Ituango was identified as an ideal site for the same. The project is being developed by Colombian multi-utility group EPM (Empresas Publicas de Medellin).

The first stage of commercial operation of the plant is expected to begin in 2018 and the second stage in 2022. Upon its completion, the project is expected to generate 13,900GWh each year, accounting for about 13% of Colombia’s total installed power capacity.

The total investment on the mega project is estimated to be $5.51bn. It is expected to generate around 6,000 direct jobs and 24,000 indirect jobs.

Development of the hydropower project

“The project is a part of the initiative undertaken to exploit the hydroelectric potential of the Cauca River in its middle stretch.”

Although the feasibility study of the project was done way back in 1983, the project was put on hold for more than two decades, especially because of the economic crisis during the 1990s. The designs for the project were finalised in 2008.

EPM and the Antioquia government came forward to form a joint venture company called Hidroituango for building the project. An agreement was signed on 25 August 2010 between IDEA (Institute for the Development of Antioquia) and EPM, according to which the latter will be responsible for financing, building and operating the 2,400MW hydroelectric plant for 50 years.

Eventually, a special purpose vehicle (SPV) called EPM Ituango was created by Hidroituango in March 2011 to manage the development of the project. The project management contract was finally awarded on 8 July 2011. EPM holds a stake of 97.13% in the SPV.

Constructing the Ituango hydroelectric plant

The preliminary construction work on the project, such as river diversion and access road construction, has been underway since September 2011. Two parallel tunnels, both one kilometre long and 14m in diameter are being excavated to divert water from the Cauca River.

The project also includes a one kilonetre-long access tunnel and a 140m-long powerhouse gallery. Construction on the same is expected to be completed by the end of 2013.

The process of contracting out principal works in the project, namely the civil engineering works and the importation and installation of electromechanical equipment, was also launched in 2012.

Power generating equipment

The project comprises of a 79km long reservoir with a flood area of 3,800ha and an active capacity of 980 million cubic metres, and a 225m high earth-core rock-filled embankment dam with a volume of 20 million cubic metres.

“The project is being developed by Colombian multi-utility group EPM (Empresas Publicas de Medellin).”

The dam will have a controlled spillway with a design flow of 22,600 cubic metres a second.

The powerhouse will be underground with eight 300MW generating units, each driven by a headrace tunnel equipped with Francis turbines and vertical shaft synchronous generators.

Water will be fed to the turbine chambers through eight tunnels. There will be two separate tunnels as well, for returning the water to the Cauca River. The hydraulic head of the power plant will be 197m.

A 500kV main substation will be built outside the dam to transmit the power generated from the underground powerhouse.

Financing Colombia’s renewable energy plant

The total project cost is estimated to be $5.51bn. EPM has planned to invite investors for the project and had also requested for the government to declare the project site as a duty-free zone. As per this plan EPM seeks to retain a 56% stake in the project and offer the rest to other investors. In case it fails to attract investors, the company will go ahead with developing the project on its own, with 60% debt and 40% equity.

Contractors involved with Ituango

A consortium of Ferrovial Agroman Chile (60%) and Sainc Ingenieros Constructores of Colombia (40%) received a contract worth $77.3m in July 2011 to build a powerhouse access tunnel and two river diversion tunnels for the Ituango hydropower project.

The consortium of CCC Ituango, which is comprised of Brazil’s Carmago Correa (55%), Colombian firms Constructora Conconcreto (35%) and Coninsa Ramon H (ten percent), was awarded a $66.3m contract for major engineering civil works of the project, in August 2012.

Alstom Brasil Energia eTransporte, a subsidiary of French heavy engineering group Alstom, was awarded a $225.6m contract to supply the principal electromechanical equipment, such as turbines, generators and associated equipments for the project. Unión Temporal Conintegral-UDEM was awarded the environmental quality monitoring contract for the project in May 2012.

Local protest and environmental impact

The project has faced resistance from local interest groups (small scale miners and cocoa farmers) as well as environmental / bio-diversity activists.

Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), a Marxist-Leninist revolutionary guerrilla organisation, is alleged to have mobilised around 7,000 displaced people in protest against the project construction.

The developer of the project is, meanwhile, earnestly engaged in developing an Environmental Management Plan for possible prevention, mitigation, monitoring or compensation, in the areas of human and ecological interest affected by the project.

The project’s Environmental Impact Study states that a total of 182 families will be subject to relocation. The developer affirms that the rehabilitation process is already in progress.

Despite the fact that the work rate that was brought had to decrease due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID 19), the works on the Ituango hydroelectric project have not stopped, taking into account the minimum operational personnel that the work needs and the firm intention to overcome the risks and provide the necessary and definitive security to the populations located downstream of the dam.

EPM is progressing in the recovery of the main works of the Ituango hydroelectric project, after achieving 100% of the full gap that was between pressure wells 1 and 2, now the activities will focus on the construction of the concrete plug that It will definitively seal the Auxiliary Diversion Gallery (GAD), which will be 23 meters long. This activity will begin once the works that are gradually carried out in the intermediate discharge tunnel are finished, which will ensure the entry of workers for the execution of the aforementioned final plug.

At the same time, work is being done to stabilize the rock mass and underground works (powerhouse, beacons, and transformer cavern) by installing new turnbuckles and bolts, replacing deteriorated shotcrete, and cleaning. The installation of the instrumentation used to monitor the behavior of all the works in the complex is also being carried out from the Technical Monitoring Center (CMT), created exclusively for the Project, and the operation of the landfill gates continues, electrical substations, road maintenance and monitoring of the behavior of the reservoir, dam and landfill.

Shift change

In order to carry out all these activities that seek to overcome the risks for downstream populations, 3,500 officials from EPM, the CCCI Consortium and all the companies participating in the development of the project will join the Project in the coming days.

The re-entry of workers will be carried out in a controlled manner during the last days of July and the first days of August by groups of approximately 400 people, who will be integrated in accordance with compliance with the biosecurity protocol established for both entry, permanence and exit from the facilities.

The biosecurity protocol of the Ituango hydroelectric project against the coronavirus (COVID-19), has been guided by medical personnel and specialists in epidemiology from the University of Antioquia and the Departmental Health Secretariat. Likewise, it has been an articulated process at all times with the Antioquia Government, the health secretaries and the local authorities.

EPM appreciates the commitment of the workers, who, despite the restrictions of the coronavirus prevention and containment protocols and the demands to carry out their work under the depths of the massif, maintain their commitment to recover the Project, which It will ensure about 17% of the country's energy demand, and the progress of all citizens. The Company reiterates its admiration and recognition of them. They are true heroes who build a better future for all Colombians."	https://www.bnamericas.com/en/news/epm-advances-hidroituango-recovery-works

Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi have launched the construction activities of the regional Rusumo Falls Hydroelectric Project in Ngara, Tanzania.

The project, first conceived two decades back, will when completed deliver a shared hydropower plant with installed capacity of 80 megawatts of renewable, clean, low cost power to benefit the population in the three benefiting countries.

Each of the three countries will receive an additional 26.6 megawatts directly connected to their respective national grid through the transmission lines benefiting over one million people in the three countries.

Prof Sospeter Muhongo, Tanzania’s minister of Energy and Minerals led the groundbreaking ceremony on Thursday by scooping earth with a grader at the construction site.

“This is a historic day for the three countries. We take recognition the Nile Basin Initiative platform and specifically its investment arm, the Nile Equatorial Lakes Subsidiary Action Program Coordination Unit (NELSAP-CU), which facilitated and coordinated the countries to move project forward,” said the council of energy ministers of the three countries in a statement.

At the launch, the Council of Ministers in charge of Energy from Burundi, Rwanda and Tanzania for the Regional Rusumo Falls Hydroelectric Project, were joined by Ministers of Water and Finance from Burundi, Nile Basin Initiative (NBI), World Bank, African Development Bank, African Union and NEPAD delegates.

“We are very delighted today of the fact, the trans-boundary shared Rusumo Falls project has finally come to life, after more than 20 years since it was first identified,” the ministers said in their statement.

The Rusumo falls is located on the Kagera River on the border between Rwanda (Southeast) and Tanzania (Northwest) and about 25 kilometers downstream of Burundi, Rwanda and Tanzania common border point. The Falls are approximately 15 meters high and 40 meters wide.

The Regional Rusumo Falls Hydroelectric Project is owned by the three countries through a Special Purpose Vehicle, the Rusumo Power Company Ltd (RPCL) and mandated Nile Equatorial Lakes Subsidiary Action Program Coordination Unit (NELSAP-CU) to implement the project on their behalf.

The Construction of the Hydroelectric power plant is funded by the World Bank at a cost $340 million. The project is being constructed by two contractors CGCOC Group and JWHC JV from China for Civil Works and ANDRITZ Hydro from Germany/India for Electro-Mechanical works. The Rusumo Hydropower Project is scheduled to be completed and commissioned by 2020."	https://www.independent.co.ug/rwanda-tanzania-burundi-start-construction-rusumo-dam/
Active	"Angola is considered one of the fastest growing economies in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite its economy being largely dependent on the exportation of oil, Angola is starting to explore its renewable potential as a means of diversification. With state objectives concerning electrification, reliance is shifting from the oil sector into renewable energies concerning solar, wind and hydropower. This shift has been a result of new government initiatives as well as increased opportunities concerning renewable energies throughout the country.

“Renewable energy in Angola is a largely untapped area,” said Maria da Cruz, President and CEO of the U.S.-Angola Chamber of Commerce during a webinar hosted by Africa Oil & Power and the African Energy Chamber last week. “The vast amount of natural resources throughout the country have tremendous energy potential and therefore, we have seen an expansion in the exploration and development of renewable energy.”

Angola’s renewable opportunities predominantly consist of solar, wind and hydropower, with potential for further expansion throughout the country. Specifically, the country is estimated to have a capacity of 55GW of solar energy, three GW of wind, and 18GW of hydro. Efforts in hydropower remain the government’s top priority, showcased by the construction of the Caculo Cabaça Hydroelectric Project, the Laúca Hydroelectric Plant, the Balalunga Project and several others throughout the southern region of the country. Paul Ghiotto, Deputy Political-Economic Chief/Energy Officer, U.S. Embassy Luanda stated, “Angola, through the development of hydropower particularly from the Cuanza Basin, has a very strong base concerning generation, potentially sufficient to meet future demand.” Accordingly, the benefits of such resources justify government focus towards renewables.

Following the increase in concentration to renewable energy, the government has set up major targets for the sector through the implementation of the Angola Energy 2025 Plan. Through this initiative, the government not only envisions a developed country with widespread access to electricity, but also a power industry that can compete in the global arena. According to the World Bank, 56% of the population of Angola does not have access to electricity. The Angola Energy 2025 plan, therefore, provides a high-level overview of the policies intended to increase access to electricity to 60%, with 70% of electricity expected to be derived from renewable resources. According to the African Development Bank’s energy sector platform, African Energy and Marketplace, the exploration of resources in the central and southern regions of the country means investors can align with proposed government action plans to contribute to the expansion of electricity access and rural electrification. Furthermore, the proposed plan aims to achieve a total renewable penetration of 74% of installed power capacity, with hydropower representing 66% and other renewables representing eight percent.

“You cannot expand the industrialization of the country without secure power throughout. The government of Angola has invested in the economy with the Angola Energy 2025 agenda, which is robust and seeks to invest in the energy sector,” Maria da Cruz noted. “There is an estimate of around $23 billion that the government would like to invest as part of the Angola Energy 2025 strategy.”

Additionally, the Angola Energy 2025 Plan outlines the country’s long-term energy strategy and gives insight to key areas within the country that have the potential for solar and wind capacity. “The various opportunities for the development of renewable energy throughout Angola, taking into account feasibility studies concerning solar and wind, are in the southern and central regions of the country,” said Frederico Martins Correia, Energy, Resources & Industrial Partner, Deloitte. “Such development will contribute to an increase in installed generation while also boosting electricity access rates.”

There are a variety of external factors that have had a significant impact on the oil and power industry in countries such as Angola. With oil accounting for 90% of Angola’s exports, price instability – emerging from the price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia – as well as reduced demand accompanying the implemented lockdowns worldwide due to COVID-19, have resulted in the country focusing on other energy resources, such as renewables, as a way to fortify economic development and industrialisation. The implementation of lockdowns globally has had detrimental effects on the oil and gas industry, with the price of oil consistently dropping and the industry facing a downturn. However, as the year has progressed, many countries have started opening up their economies again. The pandemic has, nevertheless, brought to attention the need for a revision of the energy sector in countries such as Angola. With the intention of expanding renewable energy development countrywide, Angola seeks to encourage investment not only in the power and energy industry, but in the economy as a whole."	https://www.africaoilandpower.com/2020/06/30/angola_explores-renewable-energy-opportunities-through-diversification/
Active	"Montana based, Absaroka Energy, LLC is developing the Gordon Butte Pumped Storage Hydro Project. The project will be located on private land in Meagher County, Montana, three miles west of the small town of Martinsdale. Our project is designed to take advantage of the unique geological features of Gordon Butte to create a new closed-loop pumped storage hydro facility. This facility will provide ancillary and balancing capabilities to Montana’s emerging renewable energy industry, as well as, provide multiple services to facilitate stability, reliability, growth and longevity to existing energy infrastructure and resources in the state and region.

The Gordon Butte Hydro Pumped Storage Facility will consist of upper and lower closed-loop reservoirs connected by an underground concrete and steel-lined hydraulic shaft. Our pumped storage hydro project will be an off-stream facility, constructed out of any existing watersheds thereby minimizing impacts to the local watersheds and riparian ecosystems. Each reservoir will be approximately 4,000 feet long and 1,000 feet wide with depths of 50 to 75 feet. As currently designed, an underground powerhouse with three turbine-generators would be located at the bottom reservoir. These generators would provide an installed capacity of 400 megawatts, allowing for an estimated annual energy generation of 1300 gigawatt hours.

GB Energy Park received its preliminary permit from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in 2013. This was followed by a multi-year consultation process with state and federal agencies, local landowners, environmental groups, and other interested stakeholders to identify, study and mitigate important issues related to the construction of this project. October 1, 2015, GB Energy Park filed the Final License Application for the project with FERC. The Commission accepted the license application as complete on November 16, 2015 and issued its Environmental Analysis with a Finding of No Significant Impacts on September 27, 2016.

On December 14, 2016, GBEP received an Original License for the Gordon Butte Pumped Storage Hydro Project. The license authorizes GBEP to construct and operate the facility for a period of 50 years."	https://gordonbuttepumpedstorage.com/project-overview/

Active	"Cost overruns associated with Colombia’s embattled 2.4-GW Hidroituango dam and hydro project could surpass US$1 billion, a leading academic told BNamericas.

The project was originally budgeted at 11 trillion pesos (US$3.5 billion), but the cost has ballooned amid ongoing construction problems. Oswaldo Ordonez, a geologist and professor at La Universidad Nacional in Medellin, expects additional costs of at least 3 trillion pesos.

“We still don’t know the extent of the damage to the turbine rooms and the collapsed tunnels,” Ordonez said. “There are also a number of lawsuits against [project owner] EPM that could have a large bearing on the overall cost.”

EPM recently announced the completion of the hydroelectric project’s dam wall, which it said “significantly” eased the flooding threat to communities downstream on the Cauca River. Ordonez believes that the milestone reduces engineering and socioenvironmental risks associated with the project “by around 50%.” But he acknowledge uncertainty about the state of the belowground infrastructure

Ordozez also expects EPM to reveal an updated budget for the project by December following the completion of further studies.

Construction work at Ituango was halted in April last year when the collapse of a water diversion tunnel forced the evacuation of 113,000 people and prompted the regional Antioquia government to declare a state of emergency amid fears of catastrophic flooding. A series of further complications led EPM to postpone the scheduled December 2018 startup by three years in a best-case scenario.

EPM chief executive Jorge Londono told reporters the completion of the dam’s crest will allow work to resume on the powerhouse, adding that two of the plant’s eight turbines are on track to begin operating by the end of 2021.

Located about 170 km northeast of Medellin, Ituango is Colombia’s largest infrastructure project in investment terms. The 2.4-GW facility is expected to supply over 17% of the country’s electricity when fully operational."	https://www.hydroreview.com/2019/07/22/cost-overruns-on-2-4-gw-ituango-hydro-project-in-colombia-could-exceed-us-1-billion/
Active	"The first turbine of a total of four at the Caculo Cabaça hydroelectric facility, under construction in the Angolan province of Kwanza Norte, will start producing electricity from 2024, Energy and Water Minister João Baptista Borges said on Tuesday in Luanda.

Caculo Cabaça, which is 103 metres high, will be the largest hydroelectric complex in the country, with a capacity to produce 2,172 megawatts of power, after Laúca, with 2,070 megawatts, and is the fourth such project built along the middle Kwanza, after the Capanda and Laúca (Malanje) and Cambambe (Kwanza Norte) dams.

In an interview with the Angop news agency and Angolan Public Television (TPA), the minister said that construction work was underway to build the tunnel for the diversion of the river in Caculo Cabaça, municipality of Banga, “work that was essential for work on building the dam to begin.”

Borges also said talks were underway to secure financing for the dam’s electro-mechanical equipment to be supplied by German companies.

This project is of particular importance, according to the minister, “because it will meet the country’s needs, as growth in demand is around 12.5% per year, which means that consumption doubles every eight years, which is the construction period of this hydroelectric facility.”

He also said that the government’s strategy for the sector is to build enterprises that help anticipate growth in demand, ensuring that supply is always higher, so as not to return to the chronic deficits and constraints that have affected Luanda in the past, for example, which led to great dissatisfaction of the population.

Active	"In the past decade, energy consumption in Angola has skyrocketed, with an annual growth rate of more than 15 percent due to higher living standards, government efforts to expand electricity coverage and an increase in available generation capacity. Consumption remains most concentrated in the northern region, which contains the province and city of Luanda and the highest density of industries, services, and inhabitants. Until 2025, demand is expected to grow at a substantial rate, with the overall system load reaching 7,200 MW – more than four times the current level – and average consumption per capita is expected to grow to 1,230 kilowatt hours (kWh). This is closely linked with the country’s plans for industrialization. While industry currently accounts for just nine percent of energy demand, energy-intensive activities such as mining and iron exploration will serve as key drivers of growth, with industry aimed to account for 25 percent of total consumption by 2025. As a result, the government of Angola has launched the Angola Energy 2025 Vision that aligns with the National Development Plan 2018-2022 and centers on creating increased capacity and distribution capabilities, supported by new renewables and private sector investment.

Generation Capacity

With a current installed capacity of approximately 5,01 GW, three power stations primarily power Angola; Laúca (1000 MW), Capanda (520 MW) and Cambambe (960 MW), as hydroelectric plants generate nearly two-thirds of Angola’s electricity. Meanwhile, the Luanda OCGT power plant is the only operating gas turbine in the country. To meet rising demand, Angola will install 9,900 MW of capacity, with a focus on natural gas and hydropower. In the northern region, two 360 MW will be installed in addition to the 720 MW currently under construction at the Soyo I combined-cycle gas power plant, financed by the Chinese government and built by China Machinery Engineering Corporation. The units will be able to operate in dual-fuel mode, meaning that liquefied natural gas, butane or diesel can all be fed into the units to maximize production. Enacted in May 2018, Presidential Decree 7/18 regulates the natural gas exploration, production, monetization and commercialization and is set to encourage private investment in natural gas production that can supply the expanded Soyo facility.

Of the 9,900 MW of planned capacity, hydropower will contribute 6,600 MW. Phased construction of the Caculo Cabacao hydroelectric project will provide 1,000 MW by 2025, with construction having begun in August 2017. The first turbine of the 2,100 MW Laúca Hydroelectric Plant also came online in the same month and represents the largest civil engineering project in the country and the second-largest dam in Africa. The remaining two 333 MW turbines are planned to go into operation by the end of the year. In the central region along the Queve River, large-scale hydropower projects include the 220 MW Balalunga project and the 400 MW Cafula project upstream. Along the Catumbela river, the Lomaum 2 project will add 160 MW of power and the Calengue project will add 200 MW. In the southern region, Namibe will see the addition of 80 MW gas turbines, while the Baynes Hydropower Plant will move forward with total power between 400 and 600 MW. In the eastern province, the construction of the hydroelectric system of Luapasso is planned, consisting of three projects with a total of 80 MW of installed power.

In addition to hydropower, Angola holds vast potential for renewables. Installed capacity will be fortified by 800 MW of renewable energy and 700 MW of thermal-based generation. The government is prioritizing a number of initiatives to advance development of renewable energies, including the establishment of the National Institute for Rural Electrification, the implementation of renewable energy systems for irrigation, drilling and milling in over 200 agricultural communities and the establishment of at least 200 new businesses that foster renewable energy solutions for rural communities. By 2025, the government will also expand its program for solar villages to every off-grid commune and population with more than 2,000 inhabitants, with the target of connecting at least 500 additional sites.

Transmission and Distribution

Three transmission systems comprise Angola’s national power grid. Through 400kv and 220kv lines, the northern grid encompasses the provinces of Luanda, Uige, Bengo, Zaire, Malange, Kwanza Norte and Kwanza Sul. The central grid runs 400 kV lines from Benguela to Bie and Huambo, while the southern grid covers Huila and Namibe through 220kv lines. To reach a 60 percent electricity access rate by 2025, the Angola Energy 2025 Vision will augment transmission capabilities through the extension of the electrical grid to urban areas, as well as the promotion of decentralization solutions to provide energy services to rural and off-grid populations. Extension of the grid will be completed through the installation of 60 kV substations extending from existing or planned 220 kV substations, with a total length of transmission lines increasing to 16,350 km by 2025.

Within the domestic transmission system, a 220 kV power corridor will be installed between the north and east, along with a 400 kV corridor from Queve to Benguela and Lubango, and a 220 kV corridor to Menongue. In terms of interconnections with neighboring countries, several lines will be installed until 2025. In the north, three connections will be implemented to the Democratic Republic of Congo: 400 kV between Soyo and Inga, 220 kV between Cabinda and Inga and 220 kV between Luachimo and Kananga. In the south, connections to Namibia will be installed via Baynes at 400 kV and via Ondjiva at 50 kV.

Cost Viability

To ensure long-term energy security, Angola will implement mitigation measures that include the installation of prepaid meters, higher tariffs and reduced subsidies for water and energy. Revenue collection remains a top priority not only for Angola but also for the continent. To generate enough revenue to cover operating costs, distributed energy must be metered and paid for by consumers. Another priority concerns progressive power tariffs. Urban areas, where purchasing power is highest, will represent 90 percent of consumption by 2025. An average fee or tariff in line with the region allows the sector to recover its variable costs, including power purchase agreements and the recuperation of investments made by public financing. As a result, an increased electricity tariff went into effect in July, raising feeds for industrial companies but largely protecting consumers with lower incomes. Supported by the tariff, the national regulator, the Regulatory Institute of Water and Electricity Services, has been working to implement a regulatory framework that enables the development of independent power producer projects. To support private sector investment in production, transmission, and distribution in the medium- and long-term, Angola seeks to guarantee the capacity of the sector to generate revenues, with a strong focus on fundraising, implementation, and efficiency."	https://www.africaoilandpower.com/2020/01/03/power-generation-in-angola/

Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn made the announcement of the development following the conclusion of the negotiations between the Ethiopian Electric Power (EEP) and the Italian construction company, Salini Costruttori, reports local media.

The Koysha hydro dam, with an anticipated 2,000MW generation capacity, is situated on the lower bank of the Omo River, in southern Ethiopia.

Koysha hydro dam to cost $1.7 billion

According to the media, an Ethiopian delegation led by EEP CEO, Azeb Asnake, and head of legal affairs directorate at the ministry of finance and economic cooperation, Wasihun Abate, travelled to Rome to finalise the vendor financing agreement and securing the necessary finance for the project anticipated to cost EUR 1.5 billion ($1.7 billion).

The media reported that under its five-year economic plan, Ethiopia is targeting to raise the national output of electricity to 17,346MW. Of this increased capacity, the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which is still under construction, is expected to cover 6,000MW making up one-third of the plan.

Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam celebrations

[quote]The announcement of the new build of the Koysha hydro dam came at the time when the country was celebrating the five-year anniversary since the construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam commenced.

“Our Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam has become the leading project to ensure Ethiopia’s vision of becoming the centre for the renewable energy in Africa”, Dessalegn said.

He added: “Considering the development potential the Dam could generate, the Ethiopian government has planned to invest in the area.

“This investment, having its centre at the Nekempte Town, will considerably improve the lives of the target residents specifically and serve as the mega business centre for the entire citizens.”

Active	"Colombia’s largest hydroelectric dam, HidroItuango, has made international headlines — and for all the wrong reasons.

From its inception, the $4.5 billion-dollar dam built near Ituango, Antioquia, on the Cauca River by Medellin public utilities company EPM, was built with high expectations and even greater ambitions.

Set to supply 17% of Colombia’s energy needs, powerful politicians and businessmen branded Hidroituango as a direct solution to the country’s long struggle with high energy costs and prevalent energy shortages.

Beyond energy, Hidroituango was promoted by elites and members of the Colombian establishment, most notably former President Alvaro Uribe as a symbol of a new era of peace and prosperity in a country that has never known it.

But rather than provide solutions, the megaproject has only brought more challenges; more than a year after the dam was supposed to begin generating electricity, engineers are still very busy.

Delays caused by technical failures at the dam site and EPM’s mismanagement nearly bankrupted Medellin’s government until the insurance company stepped in. The communities who live above and below the dam must reckon with a severe environmental and humanitarian crisis that has destroyed their livelihoods and ability to live in their homeland.

Most worrisome, there are fears that the entire dam could collapse, uprooting the lives of over a hundred thousand people who live downstream. Such fears are well-founded.

In May of 2018, a technical failure at the dam site, led to catastrophic floods that displaced 25,000 people in communities downstream from the dam and causing outrage throughout Colombia. For more than a year, those communities were kept on red-alert and thousands of people were prevented from returning home.

All the while, those who protested about the dam, and whose greatest fears were confirmed by the disaster unleashed by Hidroituango’s corruption-ridden construction have faced significant threats and even assassinations.

Since construction began in 2011, five members of Rios Vivos, a human rights movement led by poor tenant farmers, have been killed by unknown armed men.

While difficult to investigate, experts and activists contend the violence has been purveyed by right-wing paramilitary groups who were not signatories to Colombia’s landmark peace deal with FARC—formerly Colombia’s largest left-wing guerrilla group.

The scale of the displacement and the human suffering echoes an era that many in the country hoped to forget—its decades’ long conflict against extrajudicial armed groups that resulted in more than 265,000 deaths, more than 8 million displacements, and an estimated 120,000 missing persons.

The resemblance to the Colombian conflict is not an accident. In fact, its resemblance exposes Hidroituango’s origins as an elite-backed project supported by the conflict’s cruelest, and yet most ignored actors—right wing paramilitary groups, and opposed by guerrillas.

National context

The Colombian conflict officially began as an armed struggle in the 1960s between the government and left-wing guerrilla groups, most notably FARC, over a fundamental disagreement about economic and political power and who would wield it. At the time, Colombia struggled with one of the highest rates of income inequality and land distribution in Latin America.

Since the landmass that is now Colombia was colonized in the 1500s, it has been characterized by inequality. It was, and remains, a society controlled by a small elite that holds vast amounts of wealth and land at the expense of urban dwellers and poor tenant farmers known as “campesinos.”

Campesinos have long been the targets of political and economic violence, most notably during La Violencia, a 10-year long civil war between the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party that led to some 200,000 people dead between 1948 and 1958.

Although La Violencia started as a partisan conflict, it was fundamentally a power struggle that challenged elites’ monopoly on economic and political decisions. A deal between the conservatives and liberal officially ended La Violencia in 1958, but the causes of the conflict persisted and ushered in a new conflict—a conflict that lingers today.

The failures to change the fundamental power structure reached a turning point in the early 1960s. During this period, wealthy landowners began using private militias initially created to protect their property during La Violencia.

The militias were used to illegally seize land and evict poor campesinos from their homes. In using these militias, wealthy landowners not only unleashed one of the world’s worst displacement crises, they also created the predecessors for right-wing paramilitary groups.

As rural migrants increasingly made their homes in Colombia’s growing slums, the government took little, if any, action to stem the flow of refugees. Why? A government built by and for landowning elites simply had no vested interest in protecting the landless poor.

Witnessing the government’s chosen indifference and the blatant injustice, a group of poor campesinos, many of whom had been displaced by the land grab, created their own armed citizen militias to protect their communities.

In 1964, these militias became the targets of a brutal military campaign that nearly destroyed them. One of these militias founded what became known as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), and thus began what is now known as “the world’s longest war.”

To keep its insurgency alive in the face of severe government suppression, FARC turned its gaze to rural areas that were traditionally abandoned and ignored by the state for support. There, FARC provided services that the government could not or would not provide; they built roads, punished lawbreakers, taxed business, set up schools, and even administered health services.

Simultaneously, they committed acts of terror against civilian populations to intimidate the government and advance their cause. They held journalists and Senators hostage. They assassinated mayors, judges, and governors. They bombed country clubs and military bases. They hijacked commercial fights and kidnapped over 25,000 people. They were, by all definitions, a terrorist group.

However, for poor campesinos, FARC was more than a terrorist group. It was an alternative—an alternative to a corrupt state allied with rich landowners who also victimized and terrorized them.

After 1982, the FARC turned to the drug trade to fund its activities, primarily by taxing narcos using routes passing through guerrilla territory.

The FARC’s reliance on drug trafficking became even bigger in the late 1990s when mainly the Norte del Valle cartel began promoting the domestic cultivation from coca that previously came from Peru.

Because of the guerrillas’ control over vast parts of the countryside, they were able to provide protection against the government and increase their revenue, making them a serious threat to the state and rural elites, but also a serious competitor to the narcos.

In response, rural elites, the security forces and drug lords invested heavily in private militias to fight the left-wing guerrilla groups. This fueled the rise of right-wing paramilitary groups who would forever alter the way in which the Colombian conflict was fought.

The rise of far-right paramilitary groups

First indications of this alliance came with the establishment of the CONVIVIR program. The creation of so-called CONVIVIR in 1994 allowed the private sector to invest in armed self-defense groups that helped the military fight the guerrillas.

The CONVIVIR became especially popular in Antioquia after former President Alvaro Uribe became governor in 1995.

On top of his anti-FARC crusade, Uribe was known for his pro-business stance. To maintain this reputation, Uribe spearheaded the process to acquire the license to establish what would become Hidroituango—a project located right in the middle of FARC territory.

Despite such high-profile support, the CONVIVIR program quickly grew out of hand. Militia groups that had been sanctioned by the government began to delve into illicit activities like drug trafficking and extortion. Seeing the growing public anger at the atrocities committed by the legalized militia groups, the government withdrew its public support by canceling the program in November of 1997.

By then, the damage was done as illegal paramilitary groups financed through the CONVIVIR program had already united under the banner of the United Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC).

The AUC transformed what had previously been loosely tied militias into a powerful military organization that would expel FARC from its territories and challenge its control of the drug trade.

By the early 2000s, the AUC was at the summit of their power, operating in 2/3 of Colombian territory, with over 16,000 members defending not just private interests, but attacking the FARC’s drug trafficking revenue.

The consequences of this all-out war were devastating.

The period between 1996 and 2005—the apogee of paramilitary activity in Colombia—accounts for the time-span with the most forced disappearances, with 47,844 people declared missing. To put this number into perspective, the National Center for Historical Memory estimates that 80,514 people disappeared in Colombia between 1958 and 2018.

Today, the UN estimates that right-wing paramilitary groups are responsible for 80% of all civilian casualties in the Colombian conflict. Their role, however, has consistently been underreported.

In no case are the stakes of this omission best illustrated than in the history of the Hidroituango dam—a project that exists not despite the Colombian conflict, but as a consequence of it.

Regional context

Although construction of Hidroituango officially began in 2011, the plan to build a dam in northeastern Antioquia goes back to the 1960s. Hidroituango was first conceptualized in 1969, by the nationally renowned engineer, Jose Tejada Saenz who saw potential in harnessing the dynamic energy exerted by the Cauca River.

Starting in the early 1980s, the government took steps towards making Tejada Saenz’s project a reality. But they faced one major obstacle—the dam’s location right in the middle of FARC country. A fact that was soon changed by the incursion of paramilitary groups into the region.

Located in northeastern Antioquia, Hidroituango stands at the crossroads between the Cauca River Basin and the Paramillo Massif, two major drug and arm trafficking corridors that until the 1990s were almost exclusively used by the FARC. Due to their remote geography in the middle of the Andes mountains, the small farming communities in the vicinity of what would become Hidroituango had long been abandoned and forgotten by the Colombian government.

The isolation and poverty of these communities thus made them ripe for armed group activity. It was not uncommon for young people to join FARC in search of a better life or for poor campesinos to plant coca to feed their families. This is not to say that poor campesinos were avid FARC supporters. Armed individuals issued orders and unarmed civilians obeyed. At times FARC protected them, other times they exploited them. It was complicated. Nuance, however, was not something the AUC was known for.

By 1997, FARC’s terrorism had long overshadowed its humble beginnings as a citizen militia founded to protect Colombia’s most vulnerable citizens. Their terrorism served as a justification for the AUC to eradicate FARC—even if it meant killing unarmed civilians.

Between 1996 and 2008, AUC and it’s predecessor ACCU were behind 15 massacres against unarmed campesinos that displaced thousands and killed hundreds.

The most infamous was the 1997 El Aro massacre in which 15 locals were assassinated, 1,000 were displaced and the town was burned to the ground.

Although the harrowing stories of executions in the town plaza and the images of burned homes haunted the Colombian public, the massacre became especially infamous after the Supreme Court began investigating Uribe for this massacre and that of La Granja, also in Ituango, that took place a year before.

What most sheds light on the government’s cooperation, or at least complicity with paramilitary groups was the story of Jesus Maria Valle, a respected human rights defender from Ituango, who reached out to government officials expressing his concerns about paramilitary presence in northeastern Antioquia after the La Granja massacre.

Valle was assassinated by members of a paramilitary group in February of 1998 while investigating claims that a helicopter belonging to Uribe’s governor’s office was flying overhead at the time of the massacre of El Aro.

A Medellin court forwarded an order to investigate Uribe’s alleged complicity in the massacres and the murder of Valle to the Supreme Court in 2013. Military officials who helped the paramilitaries have already been convicted.

The question is, what could the authorities and the paramilitaries have gained from the indiscriminate murder of unarmed civilians in a community that was only accessible on foot or on muleback?

The answer to both questions is Hidroituango.

A War for Hidroituango

On December 31, 1997, on his last day as governor, future president Alvaro Uribe, issued a decree establishing the Sociedad Promotora de la Hidroelectrica Pescadero SA to promote the project that would become Hidroituango.

It was a huge turnaround for a project that had lost momentum in the decade prior. EPM had considered the project too ambitious due to the geographical and security risks associated with it. It so happened to be that in 1997 the security risk, associated with the project virtually disappeared. And that security risk was the FARC.

To develop Hidroituango, political and economic elites who supported the dam needed to clear the area for development—something FARC would have never allowed. The wealth of natural resources in the region and its strategic importance to its drug trafficking activities was not something the insurgent group was willing to give up—at least, not without a fight. The government’s involvement as the primary proponent and later stakeholder of the megaproject added weight to FARC’s opposition to the project. After all, from FARC’s perspective making way for the dam was making a concession to the enemy.

On the government’s end, it was also of interest to have the land surrounding the future dam site be vacated in order to lower the prices of the land EPM would need to purchase to start construction on Hidroituango. It was a matter of doing it at the lowest economic and political cost possible.

Such evidence supports the theory that the government elected to carry out the removals through terror—something they could not do without breaking the law and losing international support. Rather than do it themselves, the government outsourced its dirty work to paramilitary groups who could deliberately terrorize civilians to displace them and therefore, weaken FARC.

This was the hypothesis of Patricia Hernandez, a prosecutor in the Justice and Peace Unit, who first started investigating this alliance in 2011. Hernandez suggested that the war in northeastern Antioquia was not just any war, it was a war for Hidroituango.

After Hernandez’s hypothesis triggered the Supreme Court order to investigate Uribe, she was moved to a new post in Caqueta, far away from her home in Antioquia.

Duque taking over

Prior to taking office, President Ivan Duque was one of the primary opponents of the 2016 peace deal as he considered it too lenient on former FARC members, as much as his political patron, Uribe.

The Duque administration’s choice to continue to minimize the violence of the paramilitaries and to stress the violence of FARC is in line with the rhetoric and policies used by his political patron, and for a reason.

By putting the weight of responsibility for the violence in Colombia on the FARC, the government is diverting attention away from the paramilitary atrocities carried out in Colombia and specifically in Ituango, allegedly in collusion with EPM and Uribe.

Duque has been one of Hidroituango’s most ardent supporters, stressing its completion as “necessary for Colombia.”

The president has gone so far as to call public outcry against the corruption ridden activities within the dam’s construction as a “witch hunt.”

Most symbolically, the valley that was flooded to construct Hidroituango, permanently covered unmarked graves where 700 victims of Colombia’s armed conflict are thought to have been buried, a literal erasure of the violence that led to the dam’s existence.

Despite the opposition of Duque and Uribe, Colombia’s peace process has progressed, and so has society, which dealt the ruling party a devastating blow in last year’s local elections and held the biggest anti-government protests in more than 40 years in November.

The demobilization of the FARC exposed the ongoing violence carried out by the State and paramilitaries.

It cannot be denied that FARC’s acts of violence in the form of kidnappings and bombings left a decisive imprint on the Colombian psyche-and deservedly so. Perhaps, they have had such an impact because they affected the country’s upper and middle classes in a visible and visceral way. But in doing so, they also served as a justification for a dirty war waged by paramilitaries that disproportionately affected the poor—privately.

While paramilitaries did not engage in bombings and kidnappings, they murdered, disappeared, and displaced far more people than all guerrilla groups combined ever did and they managed to get away with it for two reasons.

Firstly, unlike FARC, paramilitaries never had intentions to take over the Colombian government. In fact, in many cases, like the case of Hidroituango shows, they were the state. Secondly, and with greater implications, paramilitaries disproportionately targeted the poor, communities that have long been ignored and rendered voiceless in Colombian society.

However, if the protests continue in 2020 and manage to go a step further, they could also get at something even more profound. They could be a reckoning with a longstanding Colombian tradition—the tradition of elites using extrajudicial violence against the poor to maintain one of the most unequal social orders in the western hemisphere.

As of today, that reckoning has yet to come.

But the solution remains clear. In order to heal, Colombia must deal with its original sin–inequality. To start, it has to place the terrorism of paramilitaries and guerrilla groups on equal footing. Only then, can it become a true democracy."	https://colombiareports.com/how-paramilitaries-laid-the-foundation-for-colombias-largest-hydroelectric-dam/
Active	"Iran Begins Construction Of Bakhtiari Dam Project

Construction of the massive Bakhtiari Dam is now officially under way thanks to an inauguration of the project by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.



The Khatam al-Anbiya (KAA), which is controlled by Iran's military, will build the double-arch concrete dam on the Bakhtiari River in the Zagros Mountains of Iran's southwestern Lorestan Province. The dam can hold 4.8 billion cubic meters of water, the largest reservoir in the country, and will produce 1,500 megawatts of electricity.



The Chinese firm Sinohydro Corp. was contracted in 2011 to build the dam for US$ 2 billion, but the Iranian central bank cancelled the contract in May and turned over the project to the IRGC and KAA. No reason and notice of cancellation was given to Sinohydro.



When completed, the Bakhtiari dam will be the second-tallest in the world after Tajikistan's 335 meters tall Rogun Dam now under construction. The new dam will have a height of 315 meters and a length of 434 meters when completed.



Currently, the tallest dam is the Jinping-I Dam, an arch dam in China standing 305 meters high. The second-tallest is the 300 meter Nurek Dam also in Tajikistan."	https://www.construction.am/news/328-iran-begins-construction-of-bakhtiari-dam-project/

Ambrósio, who made the remarks at the end of a visit by members of Malanje civil society, said the work was about 90% complete and that the two turbines that are yet to fire up should start operating between June and December.

He also said that the goal of the project for this year is to complete the work, with the commissioning of turbines five and six, in order to proceed to final delivery to the Angolan government, according to Angolan state news agency Angop.

The Laúca Hydroelectric Plant is a public work under the responsibility of the Office of Utilisation of the Middle Kwanza and is located at kilometre 307.5 of the Kwanza River, about 47 kilometres downstream of the Capanda Hydroelectric Plant.

The Laúca plant, which is considered to be the largest civil engineering project ever in the country and the second largest dam in Africa, will serve 8 million people, reaching the central provinces of Huambo and Bié this year.

The dam projected to produce 1,998 megawatts of energy with six turbines of 333 megawatts each in two plants, with the first turbine coming into operation in August 2017.

The work was financed by a Brazilian credit facility and in its various phases the project hired about 13,000 workers. Work began in 2012 with Brazilian group Odebrecht as contractor.

In order to comprehend the lifestyles and worldview of the tribes of the Lower Omo Valley in southwestern Ethiopia, first of all we must suspend all judgement. The ritual described may seem cruel but the child is peaceful and like the rest of the Hamer tribe his mother believes this act, which would be considered a form of violence elsewhere, can protect him from malaria. And if anything, it serves to prepare him for a hard life of daily toil and suffering. What’s important, therefore, isn’t to deliberate on what’s right and what’s wrong, but to gain a clearer picture in order to understand whether these peoples’ ways of life should be preserved. And, more importantly, who gets to decide this.

Where the journey will take us

Searching for water

We use water from the river. Before it was full but now there’s less, I don’t know why. Lorogue, Dassanech tribe elder

“Everything has changed in the past few years,” says tour guide John Lomala of the Dassanech, one of the area’s most populous tribes, 48,000 people who live along the Omo River. In total, the Lower Omo Valley’s indigenous population is of 200,000 inhabitants divided into pastoralist tribes whose origins, languages, customs, cultures and physical appearance differ from one another, as does the complexity of their agricultural systems. Eight groups were officially recognised in the government’s 2007 census, the last, but many anthropologists speak of much higher numbers: from twelve to sixteen, to a couple dozen. In the whole of Ethiopia, described as the “museum of peoples” by late 18th-early 19th century Italian historian Carlo Conti Rossini, there are more than eighty ethnic groups.

90,000 people live along the banks of the Omo River and depend on its natural cycle of seasonal floods to fertilise the soil. The river’s source lies at 2,400 metres in altitude and runs for 700 kilometres until il reaches the Turkana, the largest desert lake in the world, at 100 metres above sea level, which marks the passage into Kenya. It’s a vital source of sustenance for the inhabitants of this area, which is unique for its high concentration of native populations who “still live fully in contact with nature, like humans did 3,000-4,000 years ago,” says Giovanni Miceli, tour operator who has been travelling to Ethiopia for over a decade and who founded the NGO Barjo Imè to provide assistance to three villages of the Hamer tribe.

Yet seasonal floods have ceased due to a massive hydroelectric project – five dams in total, two of which are due to be completed – which has led to the eviction of communities from their land and increased their reliance on rain-fed (rather the flood-fed) agriculture. Food insecurity has resulted, also due to climate change, which has caused alterations in rain patterns, longer droughts and a higher frequency of unexpected, powerful floods. “The river used to be very full but for a few years now we haven’t been able to cultivate the banks,” explains Damo Dori of the Kara, one of the smallest tribes in Africa, with around 1,500 members. The origins of this sudden change are to be traced in the first dam built on the Omo, Gibe III, inaugurated in 2016.

Hydroelectricity, a resource for Ethiopia

The dam, no question, is very important for the country: it produces electricity, therefore hard currency. But it needs to be managed properly to the benefit of the tribes as well. Yonas Mahetemu, founder of Bella Abissinia, Addis Ababa-based tour operator

The dam is an important source of hydroelectric energy and water used to irrigate intensive monocultures especially of sugarcane and cotton. “In the absence of oil or gas, Ethiopia’s most precious resources are water and land,” Mattia Grandi, researcher at the Sant’Anna School of Advanced Studies in Pisa, Italy, points out. With a huge hydroelectric potential, second on the continent, the country has decided to invest in this renewable energy source to feed its burgeoning GDP, which has grown up to 10 per cent annually in recent years, and a 15 per cent increase in energy demand (while two thirds of the population isn’t attached to the national grid).

The current government led by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali, known simply as Abiy, who came to power in April 2018, has continued supporting massive hydroelectric projects such as the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) on the Nile, which will become the continent’s largest, as well as Gibe III, the tallest dam in Africa with its almost 250 metres in height. Therefore, the administration has put its “political weight behind building a development model based on the regional trade in energy, which is sold to neighbouring countries,” Grandi contextualises.









Gibe dams, financed by foreign governments and banks

I don’t know anything about the dam. Lorogue, Dassanech tribe elder

Gibe III’s name comes from the Omo affluent on which first two hydroelectric turbines, Gibe I and Gibe II, were completed in 2004 and 2010 respectively. All the structures have been built by Italian company Salini Impregilo, currently involved in the construction of the Gibe IV or Koysha dam, as well as GERD. “Salini is basically the Ethiopian government’s operational arm with regards to hydroelectric development,” writes Emanuele Fantini of the IHE Delft Institute for Water Education in The Netherlands.

My people have no idea about the dam, they’re saying God is punishing them. John Lomala, Dassanech tour guide

The second Gibe was financed directly by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a decision that “was met with a great deal of criticism and in light of which a study conducted by the country’s national development agency suggested that the government suspend financing of the successive dams,” Grandi explains. Controversial aspects were highlighted such as “the anomaly of granting Salini the contract through a direct negotiation” and “inadequacy of the environmental impact study”, as mentioned in a 2010 Italian parliamentary inquiry directed at the ministry.

Gibe III, funded by the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China with the contribution of the World Bank for the transmission lines, also came under fire due to the absence of an independent Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA). “It’s not true that it wasn’t carried out,” Grandi clarifies. “Simply, the government’s 2006 ESIA, updated in 2009, was conducted by Italian consulting firms,” therefore potentially close to Salini’s interests.

Displacement and sugar plantations

I know about the dam on the Omo River. Allo Shada, Hamer tribe

“The inhabitants of the Omo Valley have been deprived of their land as well as access to water and the river especially due to the plantations,” Grandi points out. The conversion of hectares of savannah into large fields began in 2011 when fertile plots, some of which occupied by villages, were given to foreign investors and destined to the government-owned Omo-Kuraz Sugar Development Project (KSDP) for the cultivation and processing of sugarcane: initially allocated 245,000 hectares, the projected size of the complex was reduced to 100,000.

I’ve heard about the dam and plantations, but I’ve never seen them. Damo Dori, Kara tribe

An ambitious project aimed at transforming the peripheral Omo Valley into an agro-industrial export hub whose political and economic relevance was marked by Eritrean president Isaias Afewerki and Abiy himself attending the inauguration of the Omo-Kuraz III factory, built with a loan from a Chinese bank, in October 2018. Organisations such as Human Rights Watch accuse the government of having violated its duties by failing once again to publish an ESIA, and that the employment opportunities promised to the tribes never materialised. Only 4 per cent of the 700,000 new jobs estimated by the Ethiopian Sugar Corporation, owner of the Omo-Kuraz factories, has been created, according to data from 2016. Furthermore, many of these seasonal and low-paid positions have been assigned to migrants from other parts of the country.

My family depends on livestock. If I work on the plantations I can survive, but if all the grazing land is taken what will my family do? John Lomala, Dassanech tour guide

Environmental impacts, of climate change too

There are fewer trees, less rain and harvests are smaller. Maybe there isn’t enough water in heaven. Urmale Guyta Orgawa, Konso ethnic group

The social and environmental fallout of this development model can’t be isolated from the wider effects of global warming, of which the Horn of Africa is a hotspot. Average temperatures in the Turkana basin have already increased by 2-3 degrees Celsius since the 1970s. Over this period, the lake, a considerable part of which used to be in Ethiopia, has shrunk up to the border with Kenya. “Today, drought has become an annual feature in the region. It used to be just once every four years,” says Paul Obunde of Kenya’s National Drought Management Authority. Seasonal rain patterns have also changed, as the inhabitants of the Omo Valley describe: “The rainy season used to be four months long, now it only lasts for two,” says Damo Dori and, “while there used to be three rainy seasons, now there are only two,” according to Dassanech tribe elder Lorogue. “And there’s also more drought”.

We’re not yet getting it right in terms of Eastern Africa’s humanitarian response to drought. We’ve not taken a long-term development approach. Billions of dollars flow into these countries. Is it effective? No, because the drought is coming again. Jeanine Cooper, Agriculture Minister of Liberia and ex-head of the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Kenya

Rising temperatures and lack of water have pushed pastoralists to compete for reduced grazing land, also leading to its over-exploitation. A scenario compounded by the interruption of the Omo’s regular seasonal inundations because of the dams, notwithstanding the (until now empty) promises on the government’s part that the lands adjacent to the river would be irrigated by artificial floods.

Furthermore, the filling of the Gibe III basin caused the level of the Turkana, which receives 90 per cent of its water from the Omo, to decrease by up to 1.5 metres between 2015 and 2017; the level of the lake, whose average depth is of 30 metres, could be reduced by 10 to 20 metres according to University of Leicester hydrologist Sean Avery, who has extensive knowledge of the area. The resulting increase in the water’s salinity as well as fall in the nutrients transported by the river could halve the biomass of the lake in which over sixty fish species live, ten of which are endemic, and fishing could be reduced by two thirds. In light of this situation, Unesco has added Lake Turkana to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger.

Tribes resist forced eviction

Private property of land doesn’t exist in Ethiopia. Instead, the government gives the right of usufruct usually for 99 years. Expropriation hasn’t only led to the loss of usufruct rights but also the possibility of selling them. Mattia Grandi, researcher at the Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies in Pisa

The Lower Omo Valley is a frontier not only because it borders with Kenya but because its tribes live on the edge of modernity – a term used neutrally here, stripped of positive or negative connotations. The Gibe dams and industrial plantations represent a bold step in its integration into a national development model, though the scarcity of primary resources remains a widespread problem. For example, the tribes, whose diet is based on maize and sorghum flour, “don’t have enough food,” says Chao Dro of the Arbore tribe, with a population of around 6,000 to 7,000 people. In this context, some state that they receive food aid from the government, though Lorogue laments the fact that this has arrived only once in two years. Others point out that they “don’t receive any help,” in the words of Oruduru, village head of the Mursi tribe, numbering around 10,000.

Our village was really in fertile land so we had to move for it to be given to investors for farming. The elders resisted but government officers took them to town and when they got back, we had to move. John Lomala, Dassanech tour guide

In part to mitigate the stress on agricultural systems, the government has tried to relocate some villages, especially those around the Omo-Kuraz hub, a policy known as villagisation, which “also aims to provide services in places where there aren’t any roads,” Grandi explains. “However this means modifying the way of life of entire populations,” and the authorities have been violent in response to the tribes’ resistance. “Widespread human rights abuses have been reported, including forced evictions, the ploughing of ripening crops, beatings and rape,” according to think tank Oakland Institute’s report published last year. “Seeing as the tribes’ settlements are essentially always small, the news (of violence and forced evictions, ed.) has reached us only a fraction of the times it’s actually happened,” Miceli contextualises.

Furthermore, the government’s interventions to teach the tribes agricultural skills haven’t been successful, seeing as “in some areas these have been acquired but productivity remains low, and in others they haven’t been at all,” Miceli explains. Many of these communities, in fact, still rely on food aid even though they’ve been allocated plots of land as these are too small and lack adequate services, the Oakland Institute points out. For example, the “government promised the Dassanech and all the tribes along the Omo River – the Kara, Nyangatom, Mursi and Kwegu – that each village would receive a water pump for irrigation,” Lomala recounts. “We only have two water pumps in two villages and we are 52 villages. The government should keep its promises”.

Conflicts increase

When there’s drought we don’t have enough food so we exchange our goats for sorghum and maize. If the drought becomes severe we move our livestock to where there’s water, such as along the Omo River. This causes conflict with the Dassanech as they don’t want us to use their land as pasture. Allo Shada, Hamer tribe

Conflicts between tribes have worsened. “The degradation of pastures has causes an increase in episodes of plundering,” Grandi explains, “these have always occurred, as in any nomadic society, but the last ten years have been particularly critical”. For example, 65 members of the Kenyan Turkana tribe died in a single attack at the hands of the Dassanech in 2011 and 100 members of the Ethiopian tribe were killed in retaliation. In 2015, local media reported the killing of 75 people overall and the stealing of 25,000 animals.

There’s no fish because the drought made everybody become fishermen. The fishermen of Turkana they come, they want to fish here. Of course, it’s Dassanech land. The Dassanech want to come and fish here, so they don’t want the Turkana fishermen to fish here, then they have to fight them to chase them away. John Lomala, Dassanech tour guide

The fight for resources between the Dassanech and Turkana has been described as one of “the world’s first climate change conflicts”, in the words of a UN official. “The countries are continually introducing programmes to bring peace,” says Patrick Devine, co-founder of the Shalom Center for Conflict Resolution and Reconciliation, “but they don’t have sufficient institutional mechanisms to control the conflict”. In this context, a lot of expectation is falling on Abiy’s shoulders, especially after being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize “for his decisive initiative to resolve the border conflict with neighbouring Eritrea”. But, in Lomala’s words, the prime minister is “far from the tribes, and now he’s busy with the settlement of his new government”, as well as ferocious internal political battles. “I don’t blame him for what’s happening to us, we need to give him time, he might be able to help us,” Lomala adds, hopeful.

The government is engaged in disseminating the national curriculum by supporting the development of a capillary education system, “a topic dear to it,” Miceli explains. “When I was in school, we used to walk for two days across the bush,” recounts Ariyo Dore Zusay of the Kara, a local administrator and the Head of the Education Office for the Hamer district, “now it’s easier because the government has built new schools in more remote areas. We’re trying to address all villages by giving them access to alternative basic education and mobile schools”. But obstacles are significant as “parents are substituting the work of children to send them to school, but there’s high dropout because of drought, mobility and internal conflicts between tribes and clans”.

'Since my first visit to the Omo Valley, I've always appreciated the extreme simplicity in people's way of life, their cordiality and curiosity towards those who are different. I've always felt at home here,' says Giovanni Miceli, who founded the NGO Barjo Imè to provide assistance to three Hamer villages © Marco Cheli 'The Hamer people are dedicated to maintaining their traditions and as you get to know them they’re welcoming towards guests,' says Yonas Mahetemu, founder of Addis Ababa-based tour operator Bella Abissinia, who manages the NGO Barjo Imè in Ethiopia © Marco Cheli The Hamer practice the bull jumping ceremony, an initiation ritual in which men have to jump over bulls set in a row © Marco Cheli The Hamer are hard workers, especially the women, responsible for fetching water, taking care of children and feeding the family © Marco Cheli Sunset in a Hamer village © Marco Cheli 'The most jovial, open and attentive have always been the Hamer; over time I grew close to them and started wanting to give something back,' Giovanni Miceli recounts © Marco Cheli







Labella, a school in the savannah

“Some families take the children away from class and send them into the fields to take care of the goats,” teacher Sister Messele explains. “We’re trying to convince parents to let their children attend class at least two to three hours a day”. The teacher works in a small school in the Hamer village of Labella built by the Italian NGO Barjo Imè, founded by Miceli in 2016 to give access to water and education as well as emergency relief to this and other two of the tribe’s villages. “It was simple to think of education as a tool to put in their hands,” Miceli clarifies. “We chose a village, the one furthest from town, with the poorest access to services and we gave it a school, a walled structure with two classrooms for now”. This means the children don’t have to walk for kilometres each day to receive an education.

“The first year there were few students but the next year there were 21 and now there are 35,” Sister Messele says, proudly. She teaches the national curriculum and lives in a house built by the NGO. “To the tribes schooling means understanding how to live: for example, children who attend are more capable of protecting themselves from diseases,” comments Yonas Mahetemu, founder of Addis Ababa-based tour operator Bella Abissinia, a friend and colleague of Miceli’s who manages the charity in Ethiopia. In addition, education offers even wider prospects. “I decided to send my son to school because times have changed,” explains Esta Shada, who has also started attending class because he believes this can give both of them a better future.

The first female pupils

Education’s transformative potential is particularly relevant for girls. The rate of female education in the area is very low, equal to around one in four students, Zusay explains. “It’s difficult for the tribes to send girls to school because they’re like an asset, when they get married families receive cattle and goats as dowry,” Messele points out. Furthermore, in certain tribes “it’s strictly forbidden to send girls to school,” Chao Dro specifies, therefore “you can’t push anybody,” Mahetemu states: “families will send their daughters to school when they understand how important education is for life”.

Things are already changing, slowly. The Labella school is attended by three girls and there are mothers such as Allo Shada who are breaking down barriers. She was the first in the Hamer village of Arna to send her daughter to school, “to give her a better future. I don’t know what she can become as I’ve never been to school. She’ll decide herself as she grows up”.

Tourism, lights and shadows

As the tribes increasingly come into contact with ‘us’, the government and urban society in general they start wanting cell phones, clothes, sunglasses, jeans and shoes. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that, it’s a process we also went through. However, what is wrong is the speed at which it’s occurring, which is forced compared to a natural progression. Giovanni Miceli, tour operator and founder of the NGO Barjo Imè

“Our role should be that of bringing the benefits of our civilisation and help them make their life a little easier and their future a little brighter, while at the moment we’re running the risk of intervening too forcefully,” Miceli points out in reference to the changes brought by a relatively new phenomenon, that of organised tourism, which began in earnest in the 1990s and has grown five if not six-fold according to Miceli. “I started coming to the Omo Valley fifteen years ago,” Mahetemu recounts, “the tribes were very wild and there were few tourists. But in the last six to seven years, the road was changed to asphalt and now there’s easy access because of the airport”.

“Years ago, people in the villages would run away from visitors,” adds Dinote Kusia Shenkere, guide of the Konso ethnic group, whose territory is adjacent to that of the Omo tribes. “So we started giving things to children for them to get closer. People hated cameras because they thought they would take their soul, now they want their photos to be taken in exchange for money”. Alala, wife of the Mursi village head Oruduru, points out that the money paid by tourists is used for food. And whilst “before we cultivated the riverbanks, now we have money to buy flour,” says Damo Dori, adding that the income is shared by the community. Chao Dro is also happy that travellers come because, “before, us women had to ask our husbands for money but now visitors pay us directly for photos”.

A balancing act

Even though my life is based on tourism, I don’t want them to maintain their traditions just for my survival. I don’t oppose or insist for someone to wear their traditional clothes, it’s their decision. Yonas Mahetemu, tour operator

Scarcity of resources such as water, land and food is in part balanced by the possibility of buying goods thanks to the cash inflow provided by tourism. On the other hand, “travellers are seen as ATMs, a source of easy money,” Miceli points out, a mechanism that creates a cycle of economic dependency that could end up substituting local subsistence mechanisms developed over the course of thousands of years. “The territory is fragmented, the government’s control is sporadic, tourism is rampant, they need money, so it’s easy to fall into a vicious cycle of paying and leaving. Ideally, we should be working on encouraging responsible tourism based on finding agreements that reflect the tribes’ real needs. Our NGO has the value of raising awareness so that people realise it isn’t right to visit the Omo tribes as if they were items to add to a collection, but it’s desirable to visit fewer of them and spend more time with them”.

There are evident signs that contact with outsiders is radically transforming the tribes’ ways of life. Travellers visit the area to see populations who follow pre-industrial lifestyles but, paradoxically, the sole fact of them being there hastens the tribes’ integration into modern, mainstream society, writes travel journalist Susan Hack. “We must also understand what preserving traditions actually means,” Mattia Grandi comments. “On the one hand, you lose the open-air museum but on the other hand, it’s inevitable. Traditions are such because they change over time through internal and external inputs; they’re also about knowing how to survive in the face of adversity. Maintaining this would be of the utmost importance”.

“If we all start wearing your clothes we’ll lose our traditions”. These words, spoken by Hamer boy Dido Kaffa mirror those of a number of Omo Valley residents who express their desire to maintain their cultures alive. For example, Chao Dro believes the Arbore have been able to preserve their customs notwithstanding the growth of tourism: in fact, “all women are circumcised when they get married”. The mother of seven children, three of which are girls, provides us with another example of a practice that is considered a form of violence and a rights violation elsewhere but is viewed as a marker of identity here in the Omo Valley.

What future for the Lower Omo Valley

If it’s truly important that the Omo’s peoples are in control of their own future, their choices should be accepted and respected. What they need are the right tools to decide what’s best for them and consciously adapt to the inevitability of change. With the passage of time – and therefore the worsening of climate change, prolonged impact of the dams and plantations, as well as proliferating contact with the outside world – this becomes increasingly urgent.

The whole of Ethiopia is undergoing radical transformations, also thanks to reforms pushed ahead by Abiy, who “wants the country to develop and leave behind its past of famine and poverty,” in Mahetemu’s words. But the Arbore, Dassanech, Hamer, Kara, Mursi and all the other tribes of the Lower Omo Valley don’t have control over these events. In these uncertain conditions, the question regarding their future remains unanswered. Only time will tell if the pace of life here will continue following that of the river – slow and gentle, then violent and destructive at times – or if change will overwhelm the tribes like an unexpected flood. And if the boy at the beginning of our story will follow his mother’s example by subjecting his children to the same ritual, or if he’ll recount this experience to tell them about a world that no longer exists."	https://www.lifegate.com/lower-omo-valley-ethiopia-tribes-reportage

Active	"Description for Koysha Hydropower (Ethiopia)



Koysha (2’160 MW, under construction) is the fourth hydropower plant of Omo/Gibe river cascade in Ethiopia, comprising Gilgel Gibe (200 MW), Gibe II (420 MW) and Gibe III (1’870 MW), all currently in operation.

Koysha is a step forward in the development of the entire hydropower potential of the Omo river and represents a realization of the large-scale vision started more than 25 years ago with the design of Gilgel Gibe hydroelectric power plant. It testifies our long-term commitment for the progress of Ethiopia’s energy sector.

The project includes several outstanding examples of value engineering and design optimization, carried out by SP throughout the entire design and construction period of the hydroelectric power plant.

The layout includes an RCC gravity dam, approximately 180 m high, that creates a large reservoir of about 6’500 Mm3.

Floods are discharged by means of a gated spillway located on a saddle at the left side of the RCC dam: a large channel with a flip bucket designed for releasing a flow of about 13’100 m3/s in a plunge pool adjacent to the river, downstream of the powerhouse.

The dam is crossed by three steel penstocks feeding an open-air powerhouse, one of the intakes is lowered to allow early generation using the first two units during the first impounding.

The project includes two 6 m diameter middle level outlets embedded in the dam body allowing to control the reservoir level during the first impounding, release artificial/ecological flows and lowering the reservoir level for inspection/maintenance needs.

The river diversion layout includes two concrete culverts on the right side of the river, aimed to divert the river during the dam construction and designed to discharge up to 3’000 m3/s, and an upstream composite RCC/rockfill cofferdam.

Both the river diversion layout and the energy-generation operating rules of Koysha have been optimized taking advantage of the large flow regulation capacity of the upstream Gibe III project.

Tandem operations of the two projects allow to maximize energy generation and provide great flexibility guaranteeing power supply during both dry season and peak-demand period.

The power house is located on the left side of the river, housing eight Francis turbines generating 2’160 MW, together with erection bays and control building. Step-up transformers are located behind the powerhouse. Each unit is connected to three single-phase 400 kV transformers, for a total of 24 transformers that are linked through overhead lines to the 400kV Switchyard."	https://www.pietrangeli.com/koysha-hydropower-plant-ethiopia-africa

DHARAMSALA May 02: China has started construction of its biggest hydropower project in Tibet on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River.

The Suwalong hydropower project at the junction of Markham county in Tibet and Bathang county in the traditional Tibetan province of Kham (now incorporated in Sichuan province) has a design capacity of 1.2 GW with capability to generate about 5,400-GWh electricity a year.

The project, assigned to China Huadian Corporation at an estimated cost of over $3 billion, will supply electricity to the economically well-off regions in the country’s eastern region.

It is one of the key projects of the Twelfth Five-Year Plan of China (2012-2017); it is also the first project that delivers Tibet’s electricity out.

With twice the design capacity, the project easily surpasses the largest existing dam at Zangmu hydropower plant at Yarlung Tsangpo which was completed in October last year. According to official reports, Yangtze River will be dammed by 2017 and the project will be completed and start generating power by 2021.

LAKHIMPUR: Serial protest programmes against Subansiri Lower Hydroelectric Project (SLHP) have been rocking the district of Lakhimpur following the day when two guard walls, which were constructed in order to secure the Subansiri dam in the project, collapsed due to rain and landslide in the first week of the month of June.

On Wednesday, the Lakhimpur district body of Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuva Chatra Parishad (AJYCP) once again took to the streets to protest against the ongoing 'secret' construction of the project by NHPC. The activists of the organization burnt the effigies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal in front of the Lakhimpur Deputy Commissioner's office demanding the closure of the project to save the bio-diversity and the people living in the Subansiri valley. The organization staged the protest programme with a slogan 'Stop the construction of SLHP or kill us'.

Taking part in the programme, AJYCP central committee assistant secretary Saurabh Das and Lakhimpur president Mondeep Neog slammed the Prime Minister and the Chief Minister, who once stood against Subansiri Lower Hydroelectric Project, for their U-turn. They alleged that NHPC had secretly continued the construction works of the SLHP taking advantage of the novel coronavirus pandemic and lockdown situation and violated the recommendations of the expert committee, National Green Tribunal and the Supreme Court of India. ""The BJP-led governments at the Centre and in the State have at present supported the NHPC in this regard, so that the power generating corporation could complete the project to push the Subansiri riverine people to the jaws of catastrophe,"" said Saurabh Das.

On the other hand, becoming vocal over the issue, AJYCP Lakhimpur secretary Jyoti Das said that NHPC could pass the vehicles transporting the Subansiri dam construction materials through Lakhimpur on Monday being escorted by police only because of the support of the governments.

""The State Government has enforced the night curfew just for the favour of the NHPC only, in the name of containing COVID-19 pandemic, so that the power generating corporation can easily transport the SLHP construction materials at night without facing any hurdles from the protesters. We will tolerate no move on the part of both governments and NHPC towards the completion of the controversial big river dam. We will initiate stir against it till the last drop of our blood,"" said Jyoti Das while leading the protest programme.

Dadu River is an important tributary of the Yangtze River in China. The Shuangjiangkou Hydropower Station is the control reservoir upstream of the main trunk of Dadu River. Located in the Aba Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture of Sichuan Province, the project is mainly aimed at power generation and flood control. The hydropower station is a large first-class project, with an installed capacity of 2000 MW, annual average power generation of 7.7 × 109 kW•h, normal water level of 2500 m, total reservoir capacity of 2.9 × 109 m3, and regulated storage capacity of 1.9 × 109 m3 with annual regulation capacity. It is mainly composed of the dam, diversion and power generation system, and flood discharge structures (Fig. 1). The dam is a soil core-wall rockfill dam, with a height of 312 m. It is the highest dam among existing and under-construction hydropower projects in the world, with a dam-filling volume of 4.4 × 107 m3.

《Fig. 1》

Fig.1 Design sketch of the Shuangjiangkou Hydropower Station.

The project area has a basic seismic intensity of Grade VII, along with complex topographic and geologic conditions. The maximum thickness of the bed overburden layer is 76 m, and the height of the core-wall rockfill dam body exceeds 300 m. Acute technical challenges stand out, such as deformation stability, seepage control and drainage, seismic resistance and prevention, high damming construction, and quality control. The maximum geostress of the surrounding rocks underground is 38 MPa, making rock burst a daunting task; the layout of the flood-releasing structure features a narrow valley, high head, and large discharge; and nationally protected flora and fauna inhabit in the project area, so that stringent and rigorous environmental protection standards must be enforced.

Against such a background, a real-time monitoring system for a super-high core-wall rockfill dam is being developed in order to render a whole-process and digital monitoring of construction quality and progress. Intelligent monitoring of dam impervious soil material mining, dam material transport and blending, and dam surface compaction process will be applied in order to achieve automatic blending of dam impervious soil materials, automatic moisture of filled rocks, and auto-driving of compaction machines, all of which will greatly enhance refined project management. In addition, wall rock stability prediction analysis and rock burst control technologies are being developed for large-span underground cavern groups in a high crustal stress region.

The Shuangjiangkou Hydropower Station will be constructed in strict accordance with environmental protection requirements, such as: building botanical gardens dedicated for the transplantation and cultivation of protected plants such as Cupressus chengiana and the Chinese yew; setting up an ecological water supply tunnel during the construction period to guarantee the necessary ecological flow during preliminary impoundment; constructing a rail-mounted fish ladder and other catch transshipment systems to promote gene exchanges among various fish populations; adopting stoplog-type stratified water-intake measures to reduce the influence of water temperature changes on fish; implementing fish reproduction and release to recover fish resources; and taking measures such as channel improvement and manual spawning site restoration to protect the survival environment of fish. The ultimate purpose is to build a project that balances hydropower development with environmental protection.

The Shuangjiangkou Hydropower Station started construction preparation in September 2005, was approved by the State on April 9, 2015, formally began construction on July 13, 2015, and achieved river closure on December 8, 2015. At present, all the preparatory work has been completed, and the bidding for the main structures, including the dam, plants, and flood-releasing structures, is settled. According to the plan (Fig.2), construction of the main structures will commence after the flood season of 2016, and all generator sets will be put into operation in 2023. After the project is complete, it will increase the power generation of power stations downstream of Dadu River by 2.17 × 109 kW•h every year, save 2.96 × 109 kg of standard coal, reduce CO 2 emissions by 7.18 × 109 kg, and significantly increase the flood control capacity of cities downstream.

The Kingdom of Bhutan, located north of India, is pursuing an ambitious and sustainable energy policy, including the construction of the large-scale Punatsangchhu-1 hydroelectric plant with the help of Bauer Spezialtiefbau GmbH.

Bhutan is barely the size of Switzerland and dominated by the Himalayas, the highest mountains in the world. Over 80% of Bhutan is 2,000m above sea level.

Mountains with a height of up to 7,500m mark the highest points of the country. Many rivers span several thousand metres in altitude as they make their way from north to south, creating ideal conditions for hydroelectric power. Bhutan already generates almost all of its electricity from hydropower, with the surplus being exported to neighbouring India.

Construction work has been underway on the Punatsangchhu-1 project since 2009 and Punatsangchhu-2 in 2013. Both hydroelectric plants are located on the Puna Tsang Chhu River, approximately 80 and 94 km from the capital Thimphu.

In 2011, Bauer constructed diaphragm walls up to 80m deep for the upstream cofferdam and executed injection work on Punatsangchhu-1. The company returned to the site a few years later to carry out slope stabilisation after a massive landslide on the right bank of the river.

In 2014, Bauer was contracted to execute injection work to seal the Punatsangchhu-2 upstream cofferdam, a project that was successfully completed in 2015.

“The Punatsangchhu-2 project involves the construction of a 90m high dam, an 8.5km long pressure tunnel and several caverns in the power plant complex,” says Frank Berner, operations manager at Bauer.

#*#*Show Fullscreen*#*#

Bauer was again contracted to carry out specialist foundation engineering work for the project after an underground cavern collapsed at Punatsangchhu-2. The company was commissioned by main contractor Jaiprakash Associates Limited to carry out 18,000m of soil injection for subsoil stabilisation as well as to install 19,000 m of tie-back anchors. Along with various equipment for the injection work, up to five drilling rigs are being used at the same time, including KR 806 and KR 909 rigs from KLEMM Bohrtechnik GmbH.

“The main challenge of this project is the cramped working environment. With a width of approximately 18m and a height of 8m, the work area is extremely small, creating an extremely challenging environment for equipment and personnel,” continues Berner. “Also, we’re in the Himalayas, which presents unique challenges for logistics.”

Union minister of state for power, new and renewable energy RK Singh said this in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday.

Minister Singh said that at least 11 projects of 1181 MW have been dropped after Basin studies in Arunachal Pradesh, Assam Tribune reported.

The Arunachal Pradesh government is reviewing the progress of all the projects and allotment of the projects, where no progress has been made by the developers, is being terminated.

As on date, allotment of 16 projects of total capacity of over 4000 MW has been terminated.

Hydropower projects have long gestation period as processes like land acquisition, resettlement & rehabilitation, environmental and forest clearances etc take several years.

Arunachal Pradesh government had allotted 103 hydropower projects of above 25 MW capacity to various developers of which 92 hydropower projects were allotted to the private sector.

Of the 103 projects, two projects of 515 MW allotted to NEEPCO, a CPSU, have been commissioned.

At least two out of four units of 600 MW Kameng Hydro Electric Project of NEEPCO has also been commissioned and the remaining two units are due for commissioning in early part of next financial year.

Of the 92 private sector projects, construction of Gongri HE project (144 MW) has started but, presently, it is stalled due to financial issues of the developer and the allotment has subsequently been terminated by Arunachal Pradesh government."	https://nenow.in/north-east-news/assam/lower-subansiri-dam-to-be-commissioned-in-2023-24.html
Active	"Pieces of electrical cables rest on the floor next to a 20-year-old car in a home in Palo Negro, in Venezuela's northern state of Aragua, where blackouts are frequent. Every night, when the electricity fails, 52-year-old bricklayer and baker Alberto Jaramillo connects his car battery to an incandescent light bulb. They now eat in the courtyard, braving the mosquitoes. His mechanical skills keep Jaramillo, his wife and daughter from dining in the dark.

""When the power goes out I can at least continue working on construction during the day, but in the bakery we stand idly by if oil for the power plant runs out. That's a loss for the owner and for me, we’re forced to work on-and-off,"" he says.

Each power cut can last from 15 minutes to several hours. It is important to save candles. The Jaramillo family scans the horizon to try to predict outages. They see if lampposts on the nearby road are on, or if the blackout is also affecting nearby communities or the neighbouring Libertador military airbase. This helps them calculate when service might resume.

72hrs

the length of the blackout parts of Venezuela suffered in March 2019

the length of the blackout parts of Venezuela suffered in March 2019

Venezuelans’ resourcefulness in dealing with intermittent outages since the 72-hour blackout that hit in March 2019 extends from such essentials as lighting to entertainment. Journalist Karina Peraza, 43, has kept board games for her children and organises bingo games for elderly people in Barquisimeto, capital of the north-western state of Lara. Wealthier families have bought emergency power plants, which are sold in many stores and through social networks with prices ranging from US$200 to $500.

The situation is worse in Zulia, the state that borders northern Colombia. It is the hottest part of the country, has abundant sunlight and the largest oilfields. Power cuts are much more frequent. Sometimes, there are only four hours of electricity per day. Some communities go weeks without power.

A significant portion of the US$5.7 billion China pledged to invest in Venezuela in 2014 should have strengthened the country's electricity system. Although several hydropower and thermoelectric projects were agreed, five years on few Venezuelans are seeing the benefits.

Some 60% of Venezuela’s parishes, where 18 million people live, are subject to power rationing that can last from 3 hours to 10 days. Dozens of health and educational centres close for between three and seven days a month due to the lack of electricity, according to news site Prodavinci.

The report also reveals that rationing is uneven. The states with the largest indigenous populations, as well as the state capitals of Caracas and Vargas, are outside the programmed cuts. Since the onset of the electricity crisis in 2009, the government has prioritised the Venezuelan capital. When service suspension schedules are published, Caracas is always excluded.

An October 2019 survey by pollster Consultores21 revealed that, nationwide, 90% of Venezuelans suffer from power cuts.

Yet the capital has enjoyed fewer privileges since the March 2019 blackout, although they are still sufficient to attract internal migration, mainly from Zulia. The very frequent power failures that have delayed or paralysed the Caracas Metro on an almost weekly basis, have resulted in scores of anguished passengers walking home through underground tunnels.

Venezuela: shortages and blackouts

According to Nicolás Maduro’s government, there shouldn't be any power problems. Citing figures from the Ministry of Electric Power, the Second National Communication on Climate Change says that by the end of 2014, Venezuela had an installed generation capacity of 30,467MW, of which 14,879MW was hydraulic, 15,477MW thermal and 50MW wind generated. Some 3,388 solar energy systems, eight insulated thermal and six hydroelectric microplants account for a further 60MW.

Yet the lack of official information makes it impossible to know how well the system really functions. The climate communication, which was presented to the UN and criticised by environmentalists for its political and imprecise content, also erroneously claims that the Tocoma hydroelectric plant is functioning. The March blackout proved that no systems are isolated or independent of the 10MW Guri hydroelectric plant. Not even wind farms or solar plants.

84%

of Venezuela's CO2 emissions come from the energy sector

of Venezuela's CO2 emissions come from the energy sector

In Venezuela, 84% of the 243,380 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent emitted annually comes from the energy sector, of which 61% comes from burning fossil fuels. Increases in emissions since 1999 are attributed to population growth (despite the exodus of Venezuelans over the past couple of years), that of the vehicle fleet, and the economy. The Punta de Mata natural gas plant, the largest in the world, accounts for 39% of the energy sector’s emissions.

Amid the statistical darkness, since May 2016 it has not even been possible to determine the water level of the Guri dam. At that time, the Ministry of Electric Power stopped publishing data and accused the media of using statistics to spread anxiety.

The last time the Ministry was accountable for its activities was 2015. In a report from that year, it admits that it did not spend the entire budget on any of the planned projects. Nor did it fully comply with the following aims: to “modernise transmission infrastructure”, which it listed as having progressed 0%; to “strengthen ministry personnel’s skills and technical capabilities” (55% progress); and to “strengthen the ministry's computer infrastructure”, which progressed 40%.

Coal-fired generation also failed to advance. None of the proposed 4,300MW were installed, although half of the allocated money was spent. The official document acknowledges that the “improvements to transmission infrastructure” failed to progress at all. Not a dollar was spent.

Such weak progress could explain why the bad habit of not keeping accounts took over. The state of Zulia, home to several key projects, is perhaps one of the hardest hit. The Termozulia III thermoelectric plant, which should have been managed by the ministry, showed only 2.7% progress. Nor were works on the San Francisco-Maracaibo electrical substation, or an underwater cable in Lake Maracaibo to serve the capital and its 1.5 million inhabitants completed.

A similar situation occurred with distribution projects. Stalled projects include the Angostura transmission line, the expansion of the transmission and distribution network in the south-east of the country and a 400v transmission line between the cities of Buena Vista and El Venado, which had barely progressed by 4%.

Delays were not limited to 2015. The Tocoma hydroelectric plant, which began construction in 2002 just 100 kilometres downstream from Guri and was delivered in 2014 by Argentina's IMPSA and corrupt Brazilian multinational Odebrecht, was expected to meet 70% of the country's electricity demand. The gigantic project has a long history of inflated budgets, stoppages, labour conflicts and delays. Its cost surpassed US$9.3 billion. Today, there is only a cracked dam that never operated.

Lost Yuan

On 21 July 2014, Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived in Venezuela and pledged to invest US$5.7 billion. He signed agreements that included commitments to develop six strategic sectors, among them electricity generation and distribution, alternative energies, and freight carrying.

Of the total amount, US$4 billion would be administered via the so-called Chinese-Venezuelan Fund, without the details specified."	https://dialogochino.net/en/climate-energy/32585-chinese-investment-in-venezuelas-grid-fails-to-prevent-blackouts/
Active	"Iranian experts will soon engage in reconstructing and repairing the power plants of some regional states, despite US sanctions.

“Negotiations have been held with some regional countries for repairing power plants by Iranian experts and some of these contracts have been finalized”, Managing Director of Iran Power Plant Repairs Company Einollah Salehi said, the Iranian news agency IRNA reported on March 15.

He said that lots of power plants’ equipment, namely turbines are now manufactured domestically, adding that despite the fact that sanctions and limitations created a problem for supplying some materials and equipment from abroad, Iranian experts have designed and reproduced important parts.

Salehi underlined that steam turbine shafts have been designed for the first time in Iran, adding over the last three months, about 22 rotors of steam, gas turbines, and generators have been reconstructed.

The main activities of Iran Power Plant Repairs Company are reconstructing and upgrading manufacturing equipment, operating and maintaining power plant units, as well as oil, gas, petrochemical, refinery, cement, sugar, and rail industries.

Over 95 percent of the power plant equipment and much of the equipment in the Iranian electricity and water industry are homemade.

On January 14, Mohammad-Vali Alaeddini, the director-general of the Satkab Company affiliated to Iran’s Ministry of Energy said the company is involved in activities in Syria and Iraq and added that Iran’s membership in the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) provided a good opportunity for the company to expand engineering services to the region.

He said that Iran can compete with the best companies in the world in repairing power plants, and added that the Islamic Republic has surpassed countries like Russia in the production of gas generators turbine and is among the best in the world.

Satkab can repair different kinds of steam, natural gas, combined-cycle, incineration, and turbines of generators, as well as make strategic parts of power plants.

Iranian companies have recently constructed the 220-megawatt (MW) Sangtuda-2 hydroelectric power plant in the Central Asian country of Tajikistan. Iran has also embarked on a project to construct a hydroelectric power plant at Tajikistan’s Rogun Dam.

Currently, Iranian companies are participating in several major projects in Syria’s electricity industry, including a gas-fired power plant project in Aleppo. The Iranian largest energy construction company MAPNA Group is engaged in the construction of the 540-MW combined-cycle power plant in Latakia, based on the deal signed in October 2018.

Iran is going to repair damaged electric transformers and turbines of power plants in another Central Asian country of Afghanistan, based on a memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed in August 2019. The two countries are also considering the realization of 16,000 MW potential of renewable energy projects in border areas.

The Iranian energy firms are also active in neighboring Iraq, and Tehran is one of the main suppliers of electricity to the Arab country. Iranian electricity and gas imports comprise around 30-40 percent of Iraq’s power supply. Iraq imports 1.2 gigawatts (GW) of Iranian electricity into its power grid and takes around 1.5 billion cubic feet per day of Iranian gas through pipelines in the south and east to feed power stations.

Based on a memorandum of understanding (MOU) for cooperation in the energy sector signed in December 2018, Iran is going to help the Iraqi side with developing and overhauling their power plants and electricity grid while improving the Arab country’s electricity grid management system.

Despite the imports, Iraq has been unable to meet its electricity needs, because of undeveloped gas reserves, flaring of associated gas and an aging and debilitated power sector that suffered extensive damage from Islamic State attacks and needs upgrades of transmission and distribution networks, according to Arab Weekly."	https://caspiannews.com/news-detail/iran-to-repair-power-plants-of-regional-countries-soon-2020-3-16-52/
Active	"Bhutan’s hydropower projects, built in conjunction with India, have been the backbone of its economic growth for the last few decades. Often touted as a “green alternative” because they are run of the river projects, they and Bhutan’s extensive forest cover, were the centrepiece of Bhutan’s COP21 commitments – considered the most ambitious in the world

A new study, though, is questioning these assumptions. Vasudha foundation, a non-profit organisation based in India, recently released its report, titled, “A Study of the India-Bhutan Energy Cooperation Agreements and the Implementation of Hydropower Projects in Bhutan”.

See: Dam building spoils Bhutan’s green image

See: Erratic weather spells tough time ahead for Bhutan’s hydropower

In July 2006, India and Bhutan signed a framework agreement on hydropower development and trade, and undertook to develop 10,000 MW of hydropower from 10 large projects by 2020.

The study report pointed out that both governments have approved hydropower projects before assessing them for environmental impacts and this has contributed to adverse environmental consequences. Six hydropower projects – Chhukha, Kurichhu, Tala, Punatsangchhu-I and II and Mangdechhu – were selected for the study, and the heavy environment impact of the projects was obvious.

In the case of the Wangchhu river, the land use change map reveals that a 10 kilometre stretch from the Chhukha headrace tunnel and another 25 kilometre stretch from the Tala headrace tunnel are practically dry with very limited water flow. The two projects together affect an entire stretch of almost 35 kilometre of the Wangchhu river. This can severely affect the riverine ecology and have irrevocable implications for ground water aquifers and ground water recharge in the region, stated the report.

Furthermore, according to the report, the impact of the Punatsangchhu-I and II and Mangdechhu is impossible to assess because the impact assessment reports do not delineate significant information. Construction work for these projects is ongoing, and their impact will only become clear once they come online. Nevertheless the report stated that the habitat of the critically endangered White-bellied Heron (Ardeainsignis) is under threat due to the development of the Punatsangchhu.

In the case of the Nikachhu hydro project underground drilling was permitted in the buffer zone of a reserve park. The construction of transmission lines through reserve forests and protected areas has negatively impacted forest cover and watershed areas.

Too little regulation, too late

The study pointed out that various regulatory bodies such as the National Environment Commission, Department of Forest and Park Services, Ministry of Labour and Human Resources, and Ministry of Works and Human Settlement, are empowered to screen and assess projects for environmental, social and cultural impacts projects. Unfortunately, in the case of the projects implemented under the India-Bhutan energy cooperation agreement, these agencies become involved only after the government of Bhutan gives its go-ahead by signing an agreement with India to implement the project.

This means that any assessment is usually too late to change major parameters. Environment impact assessment for Chhukha, Kurichhu and Tala projects were not conducted as work began prior to the Environmental Assessment Act 2000. While environment impact assessments for Punatsangchhu-I and II and Mangdechhu hydropower projects were conducted but not made available.

“Lack of access to critical information makes it difficult to determine if projects have been followed environmental norms, but preliminary information indicates that the environment is taking a backseat in new developments,” the study pointed out.

Environment studies for projects were undertaken by Indian agencies such as the Water and Power Consultancy Services India (WAPCOS), Guwahati University and the Dehradun based Forestry Research Institute. The EIA reports completed by WAPCOS for projects in India have come under severe criticism in the past.

Bhutanese PM responds

Responding to the strong concerns cited in the study, Bhutan’s prime minister Tshering Tobgay said, “If they are concerned about our environment, I am also concerned. They should have met concerned people from the government before publishing.”

The prime minister told thethirdpole.net that, “I agree hydropower projects do damage the environment. But the hydropower projects in Bhutan, which are run-of the river schemes, do the least damage.”

The Dala, Chukha and Punatsangchu-I or II dams are not reservoir dams but run-of-the-river schemes, and do not damage the environment as much as reservoir schemes, he said. However, other projects in the pipeline, such as the Sunkosh dam, will involve large reservoirs, which may flood agricultural land and important religious sites. The prime minister argued that the income from the dams would allow the government to offset the environmental costs.

Moreover he said that hydropower was better than the more polluting alternatives that would be even more harmful to the environment. “When we have hydropower, we do not have to use thermal power, or power generated from nuclear sources or coal. That is good for the environment. In that context hydropower is good for environment,” he said.

His argument was that climate change induced by the use of other forms of energy generation was destabilising glaciers, and thus leading to far greater dangers to the watershed. By using hydropower, he said, “We take care of watershed upstream of Punatsangchu, the river basin, and Mochu and Pochu, the glaciers to have predictable and sustainable source of waterpower for hydropower.”

The use of hydropower in Bhutan, Tobgay said, “offsets the use of fossil fuels from outside of Bhutan, and inside the country, we are able to maintain the integrity."	https://www.thethirdpole.net/2016/10/04/bhutans-pm-defends-hydropower-dams-against-blistering-report/
Active	"In his first major interview to the Indian media, Prime Minister of Bhutan Lotay Tshering stated that his priority for India-Bhutan relations was to build Bhutan’s first reservoir-based dam, the Sankosh project. Bhutan has long been an outlier in the region given its pursuit of development underpinned by the production and export of electricity entirely through run-of-the-river hydroelectricity, which account for the largest share of its economy. While these projects have an impact on the ecosystem, with large amounts of water displaced from riverbeds through concrete tunnels in particular, they are less intrusive than reservoir-based projects that drown land.

With more than 70% of its land area under forest cover – its Constitution mandates at least 67% of the area remain so – and a small population of about 800,000, Bhutan has not faced serious problems of displacing either human or wildlife populations for its hydropower projects. Nevertheless the two Punatsangchhu hydropower plants currently under construction have impacted the habitat of the white-bellied heron, and the Amochhu project will displace the the oldest indigenous people of the country.

See: Dam building spoils Bhutan’s green image

Most importantly for Bhutan, though, is the threat posed by climate change. With so much of its fortune tied to hydropower, the country has been nervous about the impacts of climate change. Speaking to thethirdpole.net in a March 2018 interview, the managing director of Bhutan’s Druk Green Power Corporation, Chhewang Rinzin had said, “It is a grave concern that global warming and climate change could impact hydrological flows in the rivers and this could subsequently impact the electricity generation and therefore the economic viability of investments made in hydropower projects… A forecast of more intense monsoons and higher discharge makes a strong case for dams with reservoirs in the long term.”

This may have been one of the reasons for Bhutan to prioritise the Sankosh hydropower dam, the biggest on the anvil, with a potential of generating 2,500 MW – more than twice that of any of Bhutan’s already operating hydropower projects. The Kuri-Gongri and Manas projects, also reservoir-based, would be even bigger, and all three would lie near the southern border of Bhutan with India.

The goodwill generated by the management of previous dams in Bhutan among the Bhutanese public has led to an anticipation of more development, without any fear of negative consequences. As reported by the Bhutan Broadcasting Service, the locals in the region are eager for the development they anticipate from the dam.

The mystery canal

What has so far gone unmentioned in both Bhutan and India is the issue of a proposed canal as part of the project, which would run through the Indian state of West Bengal into the Teesta river. According to reporting on an initial assessment report by the Wildlife Protection Society of India (WPSI), the proposed 60 metre wide, 141 kilometre long canal would cut right through the Buxa tiger reserve, creating an unbridgeable gap for elephants, tigers and other wildlife in the region.

This report, though, was based on the project originally expected to be a 4,060 MW project. Its dimensions have now been changed, but there is no information in the public domain on whether the canal will remain necessary, or its dimensions. Only the core information on the project is available. Nevertheless any such large scale intervention in West Bengal is likely to raise issues between the state and federal levels of government, adding a sub-national complication to any project.

Nor is it clear whether a study of the cumulative impact of all the projects on the rivers will be undertaken. Both the Punatsangchhu I and Punatsangchhu II hydropower plants are being built upstream of the Sankosh plant, creating nearly 5,000 MW from the same river system. With increasing data coming in of large scale reservoirs triggering earthquakes, it is worth asking whether enough research has been done to justify such a dam in the earthquake-prone Himalayas. The example of the Punatsangchhu I and Punatsangchhu II hydropower projects should be a cause for concern. Initially supposed to be completed by 2016 and 2018, they have now been delayed by landslides and “geological surprises” until 2022.

These cost and time overruns are not unusual for hydropower projects. In a recent global study on hydropower projects compared to others, the mean cost overrun for hydropower projects was estimated at 71%. Given that such projects are based on a 70:30 loan to grant ratio, any cost overrun would add a crippling amount to Bhutan’s external debt, 70% of which is already due to hydropower projects.

The Sankosh project will be the most expensive hydropower project ever undertaken in Bhutan at BTN 115 billion (USD 1.65 billion), costing about 2/3 of Bhutan’s current annual GDP of USD 2.8 billion. It is worth recalling that the Punatsangchhu I dam was initially pegged to cost BTN 40 billion (USD 570 million), but will now – after cost and time overruns due to geological challenges – cost nearly BTN 100 billion (USD 1.44 billion).

The chance of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) only adds to the risks, with Bhutan currently facing a risk from a GLOF near Thorthomi Lake. While Bhutan is doing well in dealing with GLOFs, it is unclear whether reservoir-based hydropower will add to, or reduce this risk.

None of these questions have been asked, far alone addressed. While commentators have long warned about Bhutan putting all its resources behind hydropower, this large new venture raises many concerns, for Bhutan, for India, and for all the people living along their transboundary rivers."	https://www.thethirdpole.net/2019/06/24/bhutan-prioritises-reservoir-hydropower/
Active	"China has started construction of its biggest Suwalong hydropower project at the junction of Mangkam county in Tibet and Batang county in Sichuan province has a design capacity of 1.2 gigawatts and will be able to generate about 5,400 gigawatts hours of electricity a year when completed in 2021. The project costing over $3 billion will supply electricity to the economically well-off regions in the country’s eastern region.

China has overtaken the United States for the first time as the world’s biggest “acquiring nation” for mergers and acquisitions in the technology industry, accounting for a 45% share of the market in the first four months of this year…

It is hoped that the 18 billion Yuan ($3 billion) Suwalong dam, could pave the way for other projects in the headwaters of the adjacent Nu (Salween) and Lancang (Mekong) rivers to “fuel development” of hydropower in Tibet, Hong Kong-based South China.

China has overtaken the United States for the first time as the world’s biggest “acquiring nation” for mergers and acquisitions in the technology industry, accounting for a 45 per cent share of the market in the first four months of this year, according to a report from Dealogic.

It estimated that Chinese technology acquisitions reached a new high of $65.7 billion through 456 transactions, up from the previous record of $41.6 billion through 434 deals in the same period last year.

The design capacity of Suwalong dam is more than double that of the Zangmu hydropower plant on Brahmaputra River, which is Tibet’s largest existing hydro project.The Zangmu Dam is a gravity dam on the Brahmaputra River 9 km (5.6 mi) northwest of Gyaca in the Tibet Autonomous Region of China. The purpose of the dam is hydroelectric power production using run-of-the-river technology. It is part of the Zangmu Hydropower Project and supports a 510 MW power station. Construction began in 2009 and the first generator was commissioned in November 2014. The last became operational on 13 October 2015. It is the first dam on the Brahmaputra/Yarlung Zangbo River and has caused controversy in India.

As the Brahmaputra River flows into India and Bangladesh, China constructed the dam on the river against mild protests from India and Bangladesh. Reportedly, China had previously denied that they were constructing a dam on the Brahmaputra River, even after the contract was awarded. In April 2010, Yang Jiechi, their Foreign Minister, officially revealed that they were in fact constructing the Zangmu Dam on the river. China had assured India that the dam is “a small project which will not have any impact on the river’s downstream flow into North-East India.” Indian officials such as the Arunachal Pradesh Power Minister Jabron Gamlin expressed, “China’s constructing a dam is a cause of concern for the state, and it would affect people living downstream”.

The dam though was being “widely interpreted as a clear signal” that more dams on the river would be built in the future.

Reportedly, China had refused requests to reduce the height of the dam but the Indian Minister of External Affairs at the time, S. M. Krishna, had asserted that India was not concerned with the dam due to its run-of-the-river design. The dam though was being “widely interpreted as a clear signal” that more dams on the river would be built in the future. In January 2013 China approved three more dams on the river as part of its Twelfth Five Year Plan. The Dagu (640 MW) and Jiexu (560 MW) dams will be constructed upstream of Zangmu and the Jiacha Dam (320 MW) downstream.

The Brahmaputra originates in Tibet (where it is known locally as the Yarlung Tsangpo), and meanders across the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and into the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh. This is one of two major contested regions along the Sino-Indian border, the other being Aksai Chin to the far west (where most of the Chinese military incursions take place). Chinese troops conducted a major offensive in Arunachal Pradesh as part of a border conflict with India in 1962, before withdrawing pending negotiations. Beijing claims sovereignty over this territory, which it refers to as “southern Tibet,” while New Delhi regards it as rightfully India’s territory under a 1914 treaty. The river then continues through Indian Territory and into Bangladesh, where it ultimately flows into the Bay of Bengal.

Among the world’s major international rivers, the Brahmaputra ranks low in terms of institutionalised management. Countries along the Nile, for instance, have formed the Nile Basin Initiative to encourage peace and security, while states in the lower Mekong region have formed the Mekong River Commission (of which China is an observer, but not a full member). By contrast, there is no institution capable of promoting cooperation between the Brahmaputra’s three major riparian states – China, India, and Bangladesh. Even at a bilateral level, China-India cooperation is limited to a modest river data sharing agreement and a joint working group that has apparently not met regularly. The prospects for a larger accord (such as a water sharing treaty) are frustrated by the fact that the river passes through contested territory.

Chinese officials have frequently reiterated that China is building only “run-of-the-river” dams on the Yarlung, with no ability to impound or divert water. Yet in the context of the unending border dispute and low Sino-Indian strategic trust, many in India remain unconvinced of China’s intentions.

From a security perspective, there are three major challenges for Beijing and New Delhi. These are discussed at length in a new CNA study authored by Joel Wuthow, Satu Limaye and Nilanthi Samaranayake that assess the views and policies of all three riparian’s. First is the challenge of flood control and prevention. In June 2000, a natural dam on the Chinese-controlled side of the Brahmaputra broke free, leading to a massive flood in Arunachal Pradesh. Thirty Indian nationals were killed, and fifty thousand displaced from their homes. Indian authorities charged that China had withheld vital information that could have improved flood forecasts. This led to a 2002 agreement by which China supplies river flow data to India during flood season (roughly half the year). Yet flooding remains a concern, and may worsen over the long term with the melting of Tibetan glaciers as a result of global warming.

Second are Indian concerns that China might build dams capable of diverting the Yarlung Tsangpo away from India. These concerns have circulated in India for years, most notably in Brahma Chellaney writings on the coming Sino-Indian “water wars”. In fact, Chinese academics have considered a variety of river diversion plans focused on alleviating domestic water shortages, including one by a former PLA officer titled Tibet’s Waters Can Save China that received much domestic and international attention. However, other Chinese experts contend that the costs are far too high and the engineering challenges too complex to undertake this feat, and instead argue that there are other, better ways to solve domestic water shortages (such as increasing agricultural efficiency). Moreover, Chinese officials have frequently reiterated that China is building only “run-of-the-river” dams on the Yarlung, with no ability to impound or divert water. Yet in the context of the unending border dispute and low Sino-Indian strategic trust, many in India remain unconvinced of China’s intentions.

Third, Chinese observers are concerned about the ramifications of planned Indian hydropower and other infrastructure development along the Brahmaputra in Arunachal Pradesh. The fear is that this development will strengthen India’s “actual control” over the region by facilitating a large influx of Indian migrants into the contested territory. This would further complicate border negotiations and make it harder for Beijing to ever regain southern Tibet. China has even taken steps to try to complicate Indian development in Arunachal by seeking to deny international financing for these types of projects. Interviews with Chinese experts suggest that Beijing does not have much hope of being able to forever forestall India’s progress in this arena, though the projects themselves will probably continue to be an irritant in broader Sino-Indian political relations.

China and India could work closely to address the risks of flooding. For instance, the two militaries might organize combined exercises based on a flooding scenario.

Taken together, the Brahmaputra presents a mix of challenges that could further aggravate tensions. It is not difficult to imagine a scenario in which control over the river becomes bound up with a larger border conflict. Water, after all, is a strategic resource and vital to sustaining military forces in the region. Yet there are also several ways in which the two sides can work together to stabilize the LAC region by jointly addressing river issues.

At a minimum, China and India could work closely to address the risks of flooding. For instance, the two militaries might organize combined exercises based on a flooding scenario. This could build on a recent precedent of combined China-India military drills in the border region focused on disaster relief. Chinese and Indian civilian ministries might also join forces to discuss how flood control measures in the region might be strengthened, and exchange information on other topics of mutual concern, such as river safety and pollution mitigation. Although this type of cooperation will not resolve underlying tensions related to the border dispute, it could build trust at a low level and strengthen both sides’ capacity to respond to emergencies.

Another step would involve greater information sharing regarding dam building and other infrastructure development on both sides of the LAC. China, for instance, might consider allowing Indian officials to conduct site visits to the Zangmu dam, which became fully operational in October 2015. China might also provide more details on planned additional dams, to respond to Indian concerns about ulterior motives. Yet China should not be expected to provide such information unilaterally.

At a basin-wide level, China and India should consider working together with their downstream neighbor, Bangladesh, to institutionalize cooperation.

New Delhi should reciprocate by fulfilling its agreement to provide China with information on its monitoring site on the Brahmaputra and clarify the number and types of dams it is building downstream. The best-case scenario would involve the two governments exploring joint development, which might build on the recently established Trans-Himalayan Development Forum.

At a basin-wide level, China and India should consider working together with their downstream neighbor, Bangladesh, to institutionalize cooperation. This would be a challenge, and require Beijing and New Delhi to overcome their preference for bilateral diplomacy regarding trans boundary river issues. In the short term, multilateral engagement might cover such “low-hanging fruit” as pollution control and disaster relief.

Over the longer term, the three states might consider forming a Brahmaputra Basin Commission on the model of the Mekong River Commission to facilitate information sharing and joint activities, such as combating transnational crime. Given tensions between all three countries (including between India and Bangladesh), such cooperation will not be easy. But, if successful, it could provide a basis for multilateral cooperation in a way that is currently sorely missing."	http://www.indiandefencereview.com/news/china-begins-construction-of-tibets-biggest-dam-suwalong-project/
Active	"The Xayaburi dam is a hydropower project under construction on the Mekong River in northwest Laos, just across the border from Nan Province, Thailand. Construction began in 2012 and is scheduled to finish in 2019 but the project has been marred by allegations of human rights abuses and concerns over severe environmental and social consequences. The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank have refused to back the project because of these risks but Thai banks later moved in to fund the project. The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) has agreed to purchase 95 percent of the power produced by the 1,285 megawatt dam. ERI has worked with communities who are already seeing the effects of Xayaburi to amplify their voices and support their organizing efforts.

Project Impact

According to the project’s Social Impact Assessment (SIA) in 2010, the dam will directly affect 4,000 households but independent studies have estimated that it will directly affect as many as 200,000 people as a result of agriculture and fishery impacts. The SIA reported that the dam will displace 458 of these households but again, independent estimates are much higher. The first villagers to be displaced were resettled in 2012, but one year later, a majority of people resettled by the project to Houay Hip village were unemployed, had no access to farmland and had lost access to electricity.

By damming the mainstream of the Mekong, Xayaburi poses enormous threats to the region’s ecology. The dam will likely block nutrient-rich sediment, negatively impact agriculture. It would also impact the spawning and migration of 229 fish species and may lead to the extinction of 41 of these species, including the Mekong giant catfish.

Our Solution

Local communities have voiced concerns that the project will disrupt their access to food due to impacts on fisheries and increase income inequality, due to impacts on livelihoods and repeated relocation. ERI has supported Thai communities who will be affected by the project in calling for the Thai government to fulfill its responsibility to prevent or mitigate the transboundary impacts, and also to withdraw their agreement to purchase the power from the dam.

Soon after construction began on the dam in 2010, 263 local and international NGOs signed on to a letter calling for Mekong governments to cancel the project. In 2011, the project’s Environmental Impact Assessment was made public, sparking activists and international experts to speak out against the dam. Local activists subsequently lobbied ASEAN to stop the project.

After Thai banks agreed to fully finance the project in 2012, Thai villagers from communities along the Mekong organized to protest the dam. A group of these villagers filed a suit in Thai administrative court related to the Power Purchase Agreement for the dam. This case is still ongoing.

In April 2014, ERI, Finance and Trade Watch (FTW), Thai communities along the Mekong River and an international coalition of civil society groups from Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam brought a complaint against Andritz AG, the Austrian manufacturer of the dam’s turbines, under the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. The complaint alleged that the Xayaburi dam risks driving many already-impoverished families into poverty and malnutrition. This complaint initiated a mediation process, facilitated by the OECD National Contact Point (NCP) for Austria, in which communities at the resettlement area and along the Mekong voiced their concerns. ERI advocated strongly in partnership with these communities until they chose to withdraw from the process in early 2017 because it was failing to address key issues with project. In July 2017, ERI and FTW concluded talks with Andritz and the NCP released a Joint Statement outlining the steps that Andritz will take to address the alleged abuses, including helping to access information at the resettlement site, adhering to Lao law and improving their internal due diligence policies.

In 2015, the Community Resource Center and other Thai and civil society groups detailed a report on natural resources, business and human rights to the UN Committee on the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The commissioner for this committee officially accepted and recognized their concerns, prompting the Thai government to later do the same.

The Xayaburi dam was also the first project to undergo the official Mekong River Commission (MRC) prior consultation process required for all mainstream dams under the 1995 Mekong Agreement. Through the MRC, the governments of Cambodia and Vietnam expressed grave concerns about the dam’s impacts. They called for a halt in construction until further studies could be conducted, particularly of transboundary impacts. The Vietnamese government called for “the decision on the Xayaburi hydropower project as well as all other planned hydropower projects on the Mekong mainstream be deferred for at least 10 years,” a recommendation endorsed by the MRC in 2010. The Vietnamese government has also warned that projects like Xayaburi risk regional conflict.

In contrast, given Thai involvement in the project, the Thai government has remained quiet amid the criticism. An independent study concluded that Thailand does not need the power from the dam to meet their future energy needs. Country representatives were unable to reach an agreement through the MRC consultation process, which ended in 2011, prompting the government of Laos to make a unilateral decision to proceed with dam construction. One of the companies hired to assess the project’s impact for the MRC, Finnish engineering firm Pöyry, was later chosen to construct the project.

DUSHANBE, Sept 8 (KUNA) -- Preparations are underway in Tajikistan's southern city of Rogun for the much-anticipated grand ceremony to launch the second unit of Rogun Dam, a mega hydroelectric power plant project, scheduled for Monday under auspices and attendance of President Emomali Rahmon.

The first of six units in Rogun Dam was commissioned in November 2018. The projected USD 3.9 billion-worth project aims to double Tajikistan's energy production to eliminate domestic electrical shortages and export surplus electricity to neighboring countries such as Uzbekistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan.

""The project's goal is to solve the country's problem with electricity shortages during winter seasons, and export clean energy to neighboring countries,"" Anvar Rahmonov, Director of Production at Rogun Dam, stated to reporters on Sunday.

Constructed on the Vakhsh River in the Pamir Mountains under supervision of the Italian-based Salini Impergilo company, the rock-filled dam is expected to reach a total capacity of 3,600 MW through its six units, each of generates 600 MW, making Rogun the most powerful hydroelectric plant in Central Asia.

""There are more than 60 companies representing Tajikistan, Italy, and Germany are currently working in the dam,"" he noted, adding all works are being done with high quality and within the time schedule to supply the general population in Tajikistan with sufficient electricity.

The project, slated for completion by 2028, is expected to amount to 335 meters in height, becoming the tallest hydroelectric dam in the world. It would surpass in height China's Jinping-I Dam by 30 meters, and Tajikistan's own Norak Dam by 35 meters.

""So far, 70 percent of the work has been completed. The Second unit was achieved in a record time. As for the third unit, according to our plan, we expect to fully launch it between 2024 and 2025,"" Rahmonov told KUNA.

Initial construction on the dam began in 1976, during the Soviet era. It stalled in 1991 after the breakup of the Soviet Union and outbreak of the civil war, which lasted until in 1997.

The project eventually resumed in 2016 when President Rahmon officially launched the construction of the dam. In 2018, the Tajik President oversaw the launch of the first unit at the Rogun Dam. (end) ma

Venezuela stumbles in the dark. The collapse of the National Electric System (SEN) is an unprecedented step backwards for the country and, along with a stagnant productive apparatus, hyperinflation and the crisis of basic services, it pushed the country to a state of anarchy, provoking repression against those demanding minimum living standards.

But Venezuela wasn’t always like this.

Once upon a time, Venezuela was booming, forging iron, steel and aluminum for the world. In the second half of the 20th century, it became the fourth largest economy in Latin America, setting an example of social security for the entire continent. The Caracas-Miami route and a subway with the slogan “Caracas doesn’t stop” signaled a promising future.

All of this was possible through oil revenues and an essential element of modernity: electricity, specifically the one produced in Guayana, in the south of the country, with three hydroelectric complexes and another under construction. That’s why Venezuela’s energy twilight is also that of a power generation emporium that propelled the development and quality of life of a modern nation.

Clean, cheap energy

The Caroni river, the second largest in Venezuela, is used for four hydroelectric complexes: Simón Bolívar, Francisco de Miranda and the “sisters” Antonio José de Sucre I, II and III, all of them renamed by Hugo Chávez in his attempt to rewrite history, all of them planned before chavismo, and only one started under the comandante.

In 1946, the civilian-military government of the time explored the region’s potential and decided to exploit the Caroni river for energy generation. The Venezuelan Development Corporation carried out the studies and, in 1956, the construction of the Macagua dam began. In 1961, the dam was ready and operational, with an installed capacity of 384 MW.

Tocoma, Guayana´s only station started during Chávez’s government, has been a sort of Frankenstein’s monster combining mediocrity and corruption.

But there was a bigger plan in motion: a steel industry, a city and a hydroelectric complex of unparalleled proportions.

In 1963, the construction of the Raúl Leoni Hydroelectric Complex (now called Simón Bolívar) began: an engineering wonder at the time of its opening, on November 8th, 1986, the largest dam in the world with an installed capacity of 10,235 MW, able to provide electricity to any state in the country through the national interconnected system.

This station, the most important of the group, is the result of over 20 years of work, but particularly, of the administrative continuity of six governments. However, that wasn’t the summit of our electric development from Guayana.

The Macaguas and Caruachi

Rafael Caldera’s second government (1994-1999) was a period of electric power, because in 1997 he inaugurated the Macagua II and III stations in Ciudad Guayana, designed to merge with the surrounding natural parks, making communion between natural and engineering wonders.

Together, the three Macaguas have a generation capacity of 3,152 MW, enough to supply energy to the city, its basic industries, the rest of Bolivar and even export electricity to Brazil.

But the end of Guayana’s electricity development was around the corner. Hugo Chávez’s administration only managed to successfully complete one of the planned works started during Caldera’s second term, the Caruachi Hydroelectric Station, renamed Francisco de Miranda, built between 1996 and 2006, with a generation capacity of 2,160 MW. Tocoma, the only station started during Chávez’s government, has been a sort of Frankenstein’s monster combining mediocrity and corruption.

A monster called Tocoma

Near the Caroni river, some 18 kilometers downstream from the Simón Bolívar complex, stands a ruinous swarm of concrete, steel beams and rusted rebars. That should’ve been the Manuel Carlos Piar Hydroelectric Station, previously called Tocoma, an indigenous name, planned as a “sister” for the Francisco de Miranda station, with a generation capacity of 2,700 MW. With this, the set of all complexes in Guayana would surpass the 17,000 MW, covering 70% of the country’s demand.

But the construction was filled with calamities.

On April 28th, 2002, Chávez promised the station for 2012. In 2005, public bidding began and was eventually won by Odebrecht, starting works in 2007. The state-run CORPOELEC then reformulated calculations and estimated it would all be finished by 2014.

Vídeo enero 2012 / Chávez: ""Tocoma, la primera unidad (turbina) debe estar arrancando en septiembre (2012)"" / NO terminaron la represa, NO arrancaron ni una turbina. pic.twitter.com/m1KlG3Cscf — Watcher (@Watcher_Ven) March 31, 2019

Despite constant delays and poor execution (lack of geometryproblems with concrete and leaks), Chávez promised in January 2012 that Tocoma would be inaugurated in September, a month before his last presidential election, and although the Electric Energy Ministry’s accountability report in 2012 later stated that the project was 80% complete, the first turbine had been installed just that year.

Today, when the SEN has collapsed, the Tocoma project suffers a 7-year delay for delivery, and its cost tripled since the original approved budget, from $3 billion originally to $9,4 billion by 2017. Meanwhile, Brazilian construction company Odebrecht, responsible for the civil work and encumbered with corruption cases across the continent, never finished building it.

This reality, along with a lack of investment, the multi-level corruption in CORPOELEC, and the shay contracts granted to ghost companies like Derwick Associates (which embezzled over $1,2 billion in public funds) pushed Venezuela from its place as a continental electric generation giant to primitive darkness right in the 21st century, a present that’s much more bitter when you remember the promise of Venezuela becoming a “power nation” that Venezuelans heard for 20 years, and ended in literal and metaphorical dusk."	https://www.caracaschronicles.com/2019/04/04/the-rise-and-fall-of-venezuelas-hydro-system/
Active	"A Filipinio energy company is reportedly switching on its new 500-MW coal-fired power station Tuesday, according to reports.

The San Buenaventura Power Plant will be the first supercritical generation plant in the Philippines. The plant is located in Mauban, Quezon, and will supply power to the Luzon grid.

It is owned by SAN Buenaventura Power Ltd (SBPL), a partnership between Meralco PowerGen Corp. and New Growth BV. Meralco is the largest electric distribution company in the Philippines, while New Growth BV is a subsidiary of Thailand-based Electricity Generating Public Co.

The San Buenaventura plant’s owners say it will have state-of-the-art emissions control technology, an electrostatic precipitator for fly-ash capture and removal, and a sea water desulfurizer to further reduce potential air pollution.

Plant personnel will be housed on site with expansion of the Quezon Power Village. The turbine deck also will be covered to protect them from sun, wind and rain.

Coal supply, storage and delivery capabilities will all be on-site, according to the company.

“With these in place, the plant will be the one of the most advanced and efficient plants in the country upon its completion,” according to the SBPL website. “It will provide reliable electricity to the consumers in Luzon at very affordable prices.”

Work began on the San Buenaventura coal-fired plant in late 2025.

Active	"San Buenaventura is a 500MW coal-fired supercritical power project under construction in the Quezon province of the Philippines. Scheduled for commissioning in 2019, it will be the first supercritical power plant in the country.

San Buenaventura Power (SBPL) is the owner and operator of the supercritical power facility.

Meralco PowerGen Corporation (MGen), a subsidiary of Manila Electric Company (Meralco), holds the majority share of 51% in SBPL, while the remaining is owned by New Growth, a subsidiary of Electricity Generating Public Company (EGCO Group).

SBPL started construction on the project in December 2015, after securing PHP42bn ($896m) funding from a consortium of Philippine banks in November 2015, which represented the country’s biggest exclusive Peso project finance facility.

San Buenaventura power plant details

The San Buenaventura coal-fired power plant is being constructed in the premises of an existing plant in the Mauban municipality of the Quezon region, approximately 130km south-east of Manila.

Using state-of-the-art supercritical boiler technology, the San Buenaventura plant will operate at higher pressures leading to significantly more efficient and less-emitting power generation, compared to conventional coal-based power plants.

“A total of 455MW of power will be sold to the country’s largest electricity distributor Manila Electric Company (Meralco).”

The San Buenaventura power plant will use sub-bituminous coal as fuel, which will be transported from the on-site coal yard to the boiler by covered overland conveyors.

The supercritical coal power plant will also be fitted with an electrostatic precipitator for fly ash capture and removal and a seawater-based flue gas desulfurisation (FGD) system to reduce emissions.

It will feature a covered turbine deck to protect the personnel from adverse climates as well as to facilitate easy plant maintenance.

Power off-take

The gross installed capacity of the San Buenaventura power plant will be 500MW. A total of 455MW of power will be sold to the country’s largest electricity distributor Manila Electric Company (Meralco), under a 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA).

The PPA was approved by Philippines’ Energy Regulatory Commission in 2015.

San Buenaventura power project construction timeline

The boiler installation for the plant was completed during the last quarter of 2017. SBPL initially planned the plant start-up and grid connection in the fourth quarter of 2018, but rescheduled it for June 2019.

Financing

A consortium of banks led by BDO Unibank extended PHP42.15bn ($896.3m) of loan facility for the San Buenaventura supercritical power plant in November 2015.

Metropolitan Bank and Trust (Metrobank), China Banking Corporation, Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation, and Philippine National Bank (PNB) form the consortium. Each member of the consortium provided PHP8.42bn ($178.79m).

BDO Unibank was the loan facility agent, while Metrobank was the collateral trustee. The banks also act as joint bookrunners and joint issue co-ordinators.

Latham and Watkins acted as financial advisor for the financing deal, which has a loan period of 15 years.

Contractors involved

The engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contract for the project was jointly awarded to Daelim Industrial and Mitsubishi Corporation in December 2015.

Daelim Industrial is the main construction contractor responsible for civil works as well as the construction and installation of associated infrastructure.

Mitsubishi Corporation designed and supplied industrial boilers, steam generators, and turbines for the San Buenaventura supercritical power project."	https://www.power-technology.com/projects/san-buenaventura-supercritical-power-project/
Active	"The 5,600MW Barakah nuclear power plant (NPP) in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi is the first nuclear power project in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Located 53km from the city of Ruwais, the plant is being jointly developed by Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation (ENEC) and Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO).

Nawah Energy Company, a joint venture between ENEC and KEPCO, is the operator of the plant, which will include four units.

The ground-breaking ceremony for the $32bn project, which will include four units of 1,400MW each, was held in March 2011.

The construction of unit 1 began in July 2012, following the receipt of a construction licence from the Federal Authority of Nuclear Regulation (FANR). The construction was completed in May 2018.

The plant successfully completed fuel assembly loading into unit one in March 2020, marking the commissioning of nuclear operations.

The Barakah nuclear power plant is expected to deliver up to a quarter of the nation’s electricity needs when fully commissioned. It will offset approximately 21 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions a year.

Nuclear reactors at Barakah power plant

The Barakah nuclear power plant is equipped with APR1400 nuclear reactor technology, which was developed by the Korean nuclear industry under the leadership of KEPCO.

The reactor design is based on the System 80+, which is certified by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in the US.

The reactor is licensed by the Korean nuclear safety regulator, the Korea Institute of Nuclear Safety (KINS), and is expected to have a lifespan of 60 years.

Reactor technology

The Advanced Power Reactor 1400 MW (APR-1400) is an advanced pressurised water nuclear reactor designed by the Korea Electric Power company. It is an upgraded version of OPR1000, the Optimum Power Reactor 1000MW, the first standard pressurised water reactor (PWR) plant in Korea.

“The Barakah nuclear power plant is expected to deliver up to a quarter of the nation’s electricity needs when fully commissioned.”

The APR1400, a Generation-III+ reactor, consists of advanced features such as direct vessel injection from the safety injection system, passive flow regulation device in the safety injection tank, in-containment refuelling water supply system and systems for severe accident mitigation and management.

The reactor features two steam generators that transfer the heat of 4,000MW from the reactor coolant system to the secondary system, producing steam to drive the turbine-generator that will produce a net electrical power of 1,400MW.

The plant’s reactors have been adapted to suit the climatic conditions of UAE. The reactors have larger pumps, plant cooling and seawater intake systems, improved ventilation and a more refined intake screen design. The plant is designed to withstand earthquakes of a 7.0 magnitude or higher on the Richter scale.

Barakah nuclear power plant construction

The construction began on the UAE’s first nuclear power plant with the laying of the first nuclear safety concrete for unit 1 in July 2012.

ENEC installed the condenser in February 2014 and the first reactor vessel (RV) in May 2014. The construction of the reactor containment building (RCB) began in July 2012 with the fabrication of the basement. The construction of the RCB concrete dome was completed in January 2015.

The construction of unit 2 began in May 2013, while that of unit 3 began in September 2014. The first concrete pouring of unit 4 took place in September 2015.

The main concrete works and heavy lifting for units 2, 3 and 4 were completed by November 2018.

The plant is in the final stages of construction of the remaining three units, with the construction progress at more than 93% as of March 2020.

The construction of unit 2 is over 95% complete, unit 4 is more than 83% and unit 3 is over 91% complete.

The next step of operating the nuclear power plant is the power ascension testing (PAT) process, which will involve safe and gradual testing of the first unit system to begin full electricity production.

Fuel supply for UAE’s first nuclear power plant

ENEC signed supply contracts with Areva and Techsnabexport (Tenex) for the supply of uranium concentrates along with providing conversion and enrichment services.

Uranium One and Rio Tinto were contracted for the supply of natural uranium for the plant. ConverDyn will provide conversion services, while Urenco will provide enrichment services.

The enriched uranium will be supplied to Kepco Nuclear Fuels for manufacturing the fuel assemblies for use at the Barakah nuclear plant.

Barakah plant financing

The Barakah nuclear power project is being financed through a $16.2bn direct loan from the Abu Dhabi Government and a $2.5bn loan facility from the Export-Import Bank of Korea (KEXIM).

Contractors involved in UAE’s nuclear power plant

ENEC awarded a $20.4bn contract to the consortium led by Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) for the design, construction and operation of four APR1400 nuclear power units at the Barakah NPP in December 2009.

The consortium includes Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power (KHNP), Hyundai, Samsung, Doosan, Korea Power Engineering Company (KOPEC), Korea Nuclear Fuel (KNF) and Korea Plant Service and Engineering (KPS).

KHNP is in charge of the operating support services and cooperative businesses, while KEPCO Engineering and Construction (KEPCO E&C) was awarded the subcontract for providing plant design, architecture and engineering works.

Doosan was entrusted with the construction and management of the nuclear steam supply system (NSSS), steam generator and other related components. Hyundai and Samsung are responsible for the civil engineering works, while Westinghouse is providing technical assistance and licence-related works. KNF will supply nuclear fuel, which will be maintained by KPS.

Hilal Bil Badi and Partners Contracting (HILALCO), a local company, was contracted for developing critical water intake structures for the project. The reinforced concrete structures will provide cooling water for the turbine condensers and heat exchangers in the turbine generator building.

Bechtel provided design and project management support services to KEPCO E&C, a subsidiary of KEPCO.

Nawah Energy Company signed a long-term operation and maintenance (O&M) agreement with EDF for the Barakah nuclear power plant in November 2018.

Barakah nuclear energy plant maintenance

Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP) and KEPCO Plant Service & Engineering were awarded a long-term maintenance contract for the Barakah nuclear energy plant in June 2019. KHNP also operates and maintains South Korea’s Shin Kori nuclear power plant units 3 and 4.

Active	"This 2020 file photo shows an access road to the future site of the Luangprabang dam under construction in Luang Prabang province, Laos.

A Thai dam developer has begun clearing land for a large-scale Mekong River dam near the ancient Lao capital Luang Prabang before signing a hydropower sale pact required for approval, raising concerns from downstream communities already hit hard by Laos’ aggressive damming of the vital waterway.

The intergovernmental group that manages Mekong River dam construction says the rules allow Laos to build roads and a camp to house workers – seen in satellite images and confirmed by Lao officials -- before formal approval of the dam.

Critics say the head start on forest clearing shows that the Mekong River Commission (MRC) – which grants Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam the right to review dam projects for cross-border impacts – is being treated as a mere formality by Vientiane and its Thai partners.

Laos operates two dams on the mainstream Mekong and is in various stages of planning or building nine more, damming a waterway that provides fish, water and fertilizer for 60 million Southeast Asians and already has 11 dams upstream in China.

Part of the country’s ambitious but controversial strategy to position itself as the “Battery of Southeast Asia,” the 1,460 MW Luangprabang Mekong dam will displace 581 families or 2,285 people and will affect 20 villages. Construction is scheduled to begin this year and finish in 2027.

Satellite photos taken on April 14 and July 14, 2020 show the progress of preliminary infrastructure construction for the Luangprabang dam project in Laos. Planet Labs Inc.

Satellite images of the proposed dam site observed by RFA on April 28 and July 14 revealed that construction on the access road to the dam had progressed on the northern side of the Mekong through a forested area, with what appears to be several buildings appearing on the south side.

The flurry of clearing and building comes as the Lao government is negotiating a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Thailand and Vietnam, the buyers of the hydropower.

The PPA is a requirement of the MRC consultation process, but the commission does not have veto power over members’ dam plans.

“I think the Lao government doesn’t care about the world or the affected community,” Suwit Kulapwong, the coordinator of the Network of People in the Lower Mekong Region-Esan told RFA’s Lao Service.

“They believe that all processes like the prior consultation will pass and they will not change their minds on whether to build these dams or not,” he said. The network represents people from Thailand that will be affected by the dam.

Supporting infrastructure is allowed

An official of the Thai National Mekong Committee (TNMC), however, told RFA that Laos is within its rights to build the dam’s supporting infrastructure prior to formal approval.

“The Lao government can build whatever it wants without MRC involvement,” the TNMC official told RFA, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the issue freely.

“Though it is interesting that construction on the road and the camp has begun, even though the PPA hasn’t been signed,” the official said.

An official of Laos’ Energy and Mines Ministry on Friday confirmed the construction of infrastructure began in April and will be completed soon.

“We’re only building a road and a camp. As soon as the power purchase agreement is finalized, we will begin construction on the dam,” said the energy official, who added that local authorities will begin relocating villagers once the PPA is approved.

The Luangprabang Mekong dam is 15 miles (25 km) upstream on the Mekong from the city of Luang Prabang, a 14th-16th century royal capital and Buddhist Center that is home to 47,000 people and Laos’ main tourist attraction.

“The Luangprabang dam developer should pay attention to the fact that the dam is close to the world heritage city of Luang Prabang,” said Somkiat Pachumwong, the secretary of Thailand’s Natural Water Resouces Office said Wednesday at a meeting in Bangkok to discuss drought in the Mekong region.

“The [Lao] government should be more cautious about the Luangprabang dam that it has been about the Xayaburi dam, especially considering the dam’s safety,” he said, adding that Laos should also minimize impacts and ensure free flow of water, sediment and fish.

Laos’ ‘internal affairs and sovereignty’

The Xayaburi dam was the first large-scale Mekong river dam to be completed. It began operations in October 2019, but critics say that its impact assessment greatly underestimated the scale of its impact on the region.

In February a Thai citizens group said the Xayaburi had caused extensive damage to fisheries and dramatic changes to an ecosystem that sustains millions of farming and fishing livelihoods.

Pianporn Deetes of International Rivers told RFA that Laos’ dams on the Mekong and elsewhere were not necessary.

“Mekong dams are not necessary and now we have a good opportunity to develop energy from other sources,” she said, and noted that the lockdown of the economy to fight coronavirus had slashed Thailand’s energy consumption for now.

In a comment on Facebook, a Lao government official denounced critics of Lao’s central economic development strategy.

“NGOs, environmentalists and human rights organizations that are demanding that Laos stop building dams cannot interfere in the internal affairs and sovereignty of Laos,” wrote Vice Minister of Science and Technology Souli-oudong Soundala.

The Luangprabang dam is a joint venture between Petro Vietnam Power Corporation, Ch. Karnchang and the Lao government.

Prior consultation for the sixth of nine planned mainstream Mekong dams inside Laos, Sanakham dam, began this week with an MRC member online meeting Thursday,

Laos has built dozens of hydropower dams on the Mekong and its tributaries, with ultimate plans for about scores more hoping to export the electricity they generate to other countries in the region. It is preparing to build scores more dams in the years ahead.



Though the Lao government sees power generation as a way to boost the country’s economy, the projects are controversial because of their environmental impact, displacement of villagers without adequate compensation, and questionable financial and power demand arrangements.

Active	"Laos is pushing ahead with the Luang Prabang dam hydropower project on the Mekong River, despite reservations aired by neighbouring countries. Especially over its potential to harm fisheries and farming downstream, the Mekong River Commission (MRC) said on Wednesday.

The 1,400-megawatt (MW) Luang Prabang project will be Laos’s third and largest dam on the river, with construction originally set to begin this year.

The governments of Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam flagged their concerns to Laos and urged more time to assess the impact after the commission officially completed a six-month consultation process for the project on Tuesday.

“While the three countries recognized the sovereignty and rights of (Laos). They requested that Lao PDR take due account of their recommendations,” the commission said in a statement.

However the 1995 Mekong treaty gives the three neighbours no power to veto any project inside Laos.

“Further trans-boundary environmental impact assessments should be conducted,” Cambodia’s government told the MRC during the consultation process. While Vietnam asked Laos to “spare more time and resources”.

MRC studies have shown mainstream Mekong dams can damage farmland downstream by impeding the flow of sediment into the river delta and blocking fish migration.

The government of Laos did not respond to a request for comment.

Hydropower development is central to Laos’ plan to export around 20,000 megawatts of electricity to its neighbours by 2030.

Last year, it completed two Mekong dams, the 1,285-megawatt Xayaburi Dam and the 260-megawatt Don Sahong Dam, despite objections by environmental groups.

Just as the new dams came online, the river waters sank to their lowest levels in more than half a century, prompting questions from environmentalists.

The Luang Prabang project is a joint development among the government of Laos, subsidiaries of Vietnamese oil and gas company, PetroVietnam Power Cooperation, and Thai construction giant Ch Karnchang PCL.

The consultation outcome was never in doubt, said Pianporn Deetes, a Thai activist of the group International Rivers.

“This process has…never led to meaningful debate about impact or problems that may arise from these hydropower projects. So the questions raised by people, NGOs and governments has never received a proper reply.”

Luang Prabang Dam Hydropower Project

Active	"Construction of 1,400-megawatt (MW) Luang Prabang hydropower dam project slated to begin later in 2020

On a wide bank of the Mekong River, yellow markers and visits by surveyors show preparations underway to build Laos’ third and largest dam on Southeast Asia’s most vital waterway.

About an hour downstream, in the laid-back tourist centre of Luang Prabang, the dam’s developers heard this week from citizens groups arguing for a delay to the 1,400-megawatt (MW) hydropower project.

Sceptics say the Lao government and its Vietnamese and Thai partners should wait to assess any impact on downstream fishing and farming from the recently completed Xayaburi dam, Laos’ first mainstream Mekong hydropower project.

Faced with growing pressure from dams, pollution and sand mining, concerns are mounting about the health of the river and those whose livelihoods depend on it.

Construction on the Luang Prabang project is slated to begin later this year, but some nearby villagers said they still don’t know when or if they will be relocated.

“We have not heard anything, but if it happens there is no choice for us,” said a farmer interviewed near the dam site, who gave his name only as Somphorn.

The past year has been fraught for the 2,390-km (1,485 mile) Lower Mekong, which supports 60 million people as it flows from China into Laos, past Myanmar and Thailand and through Cambodia and Vietnam.

Water levels hit lows not seen for 50 years, as residents worried about the effects of climate change and 11 dams that China has built in its territory, which many believe are holding back waters.

China’s embassy in Bangkok says a severe drought has impacted the region since early 2019 and it has increased the outflow of water from upstream at Thailand’s request.

In the past four months, Laos has also opened the first two dams on the Lower Mekong – the 1,200 MW Xayaburi and the smaller Don Sahong – after years of opposition from environmentalists.

Laos’ unprecedented dam-building boom has seen around 50 dams built in the last 15 years, with at least 50 more under construction and a further 288 planned for its hundreds of rivers and streams.

If all the projects are built, they would bring the landlocked country’s hydropower capacity to 27,000 MW, from just 700 MW in 2005, according to data compiled by the Stimson Center in Washington.

This week’s forum in Laos was to report on the Luang Prabang project’s consultation process, and the hosts assured doubters their concerns would be heard.

“Your participation is not just a hoop we have to jump through. It is not a rubber stamp of the process,” said An Pich Hatda, CEO of the Mekong River Commission (MRC) Secretariat.

Others are not so sure.

“It’s like they half-heartedly listen to our concerns,” said Pittipat Puangpan, a 56-year-old Thai farmer who attended another consultation last month in Thailand.

Chief among those concerns is the effectiveness of the sediment gates and complicated sets of locks called fish elevators or lifts at Xayaburi, which the Luang Prabang project uses as a model.

Efforts to reassure sceptics have sometimes fallen flat.

Showing animated designs for the proposed dam in Luang Prabang this week, an official paused at a complicated depiction of fish navigating one of the fish elevators.

“Maybe sometimes we should be training the fish how to use the lift,” quipped Vithounlabandish Thommabout, deputy director of Laos’ Ministry of Energy and Mines, drawing only scattered chuckles.

Xayaburi’s operator is a joint venture between the Communist Lao government and a subsidiary of Thai construction giant Ch Karnchang PCL.

The Thai company, which is also slated to build the Luang Prabang dam, says it has spent $200 million on the measures to protect the ecosystem.

But the technology had not been tested in the region.

Thai hydrologist Pongsak Suttinon wants more data before the Luang Prabang project goes forward.

“We’ve never had dams in the mainstream of the Lower Mekong before Xayaburi, so a lot of the engineering information was theoretical,” said Pongsak, who lectures at Bangkok’s Chulalongkorn University.

A Xayaburi power company representative said it was too early to share information on how the fish pass-throughs were working and that a full picture would require at least two years.

“You cannot decide after one year, you have to have several cycles of migration,” he said.

Despite unanswered questions about Xayaburi, groundbreaking at Luang Prabang is likely to go forward after the consultation period ends in April, many observers say.

That is because no country can veto another nation’s project under the 1995 Mekong treaty signed by Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.

Plus, in recent years, state-owned and private companies in all of the Mekong region have invested in Laos dams. One partner in Luang Prabang is a subsidiary of Vietnam’s state-owned Petrovietnam.

With money to be made on investment and many fast-growing countries eager to buy electricity, no Mekong country seems inclined to oppose the new project.

Chanthanet Boualapha, secretary general of the Lao National Mekong Committee, said Laos will try to address all concerns about the Luang Prabang dam, but pulling the country out of poverty is the first priority.

“We have the potential for hydropower … so we have to do the dams. That is our choice.”

Last weekend Venezuela experienced the worst blackout in its history. Monday, March 11, marked the fourth day of the blackout, which affected nearly all of Venezuela. Power was intermittently restored on Sunday and Monday in parts of Caracas and elsewhere. But areas of western Venezuela had received no electricity since Thursday, with The New York Times on Monday publishing an article titled “No End in Sight to Venezuela’s Blackout, Experts Warn.” Ad Policy

This unprecedented situation provides a terrifying image of Venezuela’s present and future: a nation plunged in darkness, crumbling infrastructure, anxious and desperate citizens, a political class that lacks the resources and will to resolve the situation, and increasingly open opposition calls for foreign or domestic military intervention to “solve” the crisis. In addition to the everyday annoyances, anxieties, and worse suffered by millions of people, the most alarming aspect of the blackout is the lack of power in hospitals and food-storage areas. To be blunt: People are dying, and more will die the longer the blackout continues. The same can be said, on a larger scale, about Venezuela’s current crisis. This reality underlines the urgency of understanding the roots of the crisis and figuring out a way to resolve it.

To many, the cause of the blackout, and of Venezuela’s broader crisis, is obvious. Hours into the blackout, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted, “The power outage and the devastation hurting ordinary Venezuelans is not because of the USA. It’s not because of Colombia. It’s not Ecuador or Brazil, Europe or anywhere else. Power shortages and starvation are the result of the Maduro regime’s incompetence.” He followed with two more tweets: “Maduro’s policies bring nothing but darkness” and “No food. No medicine. Now, no power. Next, no Maduro.”

Maduro, in turn, blamed the United States for the blackout, tweeting (in Spanish), “The electric war announced and directed by US imperialism against our people will be defeated. Nothing and no one can defeat the people of Bolívar and Chávez. All-out unity of patriots!” Related Articles Trump’s Other ‘National Emergency’: Sanctions That Kill Venezuelans Mark Weisbrot Salvador Allende Offers a Way Out for Venezuela’s Maduro Ariel Dorfman

These tweets sum up the competing narratives about the causes of the blackout, and of Venezuela’s broader crisis. To most critics inside and outside the country, both are due to Maduro’s incompetence and venality. The obvious solution is thus to get rid of Maduro. To defenders of Maduro, the primary—and for some the sole—cause of the blackout and broader crisis is the “economic-cum-electric war” waged against Venezuela by the United States and the domestic opposition, now led by Juan Guaidó, who declared himself Venezuela’s interim president on January 23. The solution, in this view, is to defeat imperialism.

However comforting these narratives are, neither does justice to Venezuela’s reality. The blackout and the broader crisis are not entirely the fault of Maduro, nor of the United States and the domestic opposition. The urgency of the situation demands recognition of shared responsibility for the crisis. This, in turn, points to the need for a negotiated, political resolution.

Take the blackout. Only the most myopic analysis could ignore the government’s clear responsibility for the perilous state of Venezuela’s electric grid. The most damning proof of this is the fact that the government has funneled over $9 billion to construction of the Tocoma Dam. This project, which was announced in 2002 and began construction in 2008, was supposed to alleviate pressure on the Guri Dam, which supplies up to 80 percent of Venezuela’s electricity. (Problems at the Guri Dam—an “attack,” according to the government—are behind the current blackout.) The Tocoma Dam has yet to produce any electricity. An expert with years of field experience recently commented that he doubts the dam is more than 20 percent complete. This contradicts the claim by the scandal-ridden Brazilian construction firm Odebrecht—which was contracted by the Venezuelan government to assist with construction and has allegedly received over $4 billion to do so—that the project was 98 percent complete. This fiasco points to the intertwined problems of government mismanagement and corruption, problems not limited to the electric grid but pervasive throughout the Venezuelan state. Current Issue View our current issue

For US officials, most of the mainstream media, and opposition leaders in Venezuela, this is the end of the story. Yet things are not so simple. Over the past 10 years blackouts have become a regular occurrence. The current blackout is significantly worse, however, in both its breadth and duration. A key reason is the lack of diesel and gasoline, which are needed to fuel backup generators. As The New York Times notes, “Not one of more than a dozen diesel- and natural gas-powered backup plants built by the government in the last decade came online to compensate for the Guri outage.” Buried at the end of this story, the Times says that US “sanctions have affected Venezuela’s ability to import and produce the fuel required by the thermal power plants that could have backed up the Guri plant once it failed.”

In other words, US actions are a key reason this blackout has been so prolonged and devastating. To be blunt: Washington is directly responsible for increasing Venezuelans’ suffering. Mark Weisbrot argues that “the death toll from the [US] sanctions…is likely in the thousands or tens of thousands so far.” As Weisbrot notes, US sanctions have been wreaking havoc on Venezuela for years, with the damage set to increase dramatically in the wake of the extremely debilitating sanctions imposed on Venezuela’s oil sector in late January.

The most appalling aspect of US policy toward Venezuela is that the officials directing it, including Florida Senator Marco Rubio, appear to be fully aware of the suffering they are causing. CBS Miami recently reported that Rubio “predicted the Maduro regime will be crippled by increased sanctions. ‘Over the next few weeks, Venezuela is going to enter a period of suffering, no nation in our hemisphere has ever confronted in modern history,’ he said.”

All this makes it difficult to entirely dismiss claims that the blackout could have been an act of sabotage. A recent story in Forbes—hardly a bastion of pro-Chavista thinking—makes this argument: “While the reality is that Venezuela’s blackout was most likely due to chronic underfunding of its electrical infrastructure and deferred maintenance, the idea of a foreign nation state manipulating an adversary’s power grid to force a governmental transition is very real.”

Available evidence suggests that the blackout was not caused by sabotage, but by the electric grid being pushed to the brink by years of increased use and a lack of investment and maintenance. Yet it is impossible to ignore the fact that US officials, and some within the Venezuelan opposition, appear to relish the idea of increasing the suffering of ordinary Venezuelans as a way to generate more popular pressure against Maduro. It is not implausible to think that some US officials and opposition leaders would entertain ideas about sabotaging public infrastructure to achieve this end. Indeed, sectors of the far-right opposition, which Guaidó has close connections to (most clearly through his mentor, Leopoldo López), have engaged in precisely such actions in the past.

Getting to the bottom of the blackout is important; journalists based in Venezuela should investigate the possible causes. Whatever they find will not, however, put to rest the narratives recounted above. Whatever the truth, millions of Venezuelans will blame Maduro for the blackout no matter what. (To be sure, his administration deserves very significant blame. Even if the immediate cause was sabotage, the underlying factors that have made the blackout a national emergency—mismanagement, corruption, and underinvestment—are largely the government’s fault.) A smaller but not insignificant percentage of Venezuelans are likely to believe just as firmly the “electric war” narrative.

This underscores the messiness of Venezuela’s crisis. As I have discussed at length here, it is impossible to solely blame the government or the United States and the far-right sectors of the opposition. There is shared, which is not to say equal, responsibility for the collapse of Venezuela’s economy, the outmigration of 3 million people (and counting) in recent years, the hyperinflation that has rendered the Venezuelan currency, the bolívar, all but worthless, and the violence that has claimed hundreds of lives in recent years. By mismanaging currency policy, failing to make significant progress diversifying the economy, tolerating massive corruption, and engaging in repressive and authoritarian actions—including against the left and popular sectors—the government bears primary responsibility for the country’s dire situation. Yet blaming the government for everything ignores how violence by the far-right opposition, with funding and encouragement from the United States, as well as past and present US sanctions, have also contributed to Venezuelans’ suffering.

In addition to acknowledging the shared responsibility for the crisis—among the government, radical sectors of the opposition, and the United States—it is also important to recognize the continued polarization of Venezuelan society. Polls indicate a solid majority of Venezuelans want Maduro to go, but most want this to happen through negotiations, not foreign intervention. Guaidó’s popularity appears to have risen recently, with a late February poll by leading Venezuelan pollster Datanalisis indicating that his popularity is at 61 percent and that he would trounce Maduro in a presidential election by a 77-23 margin. Yet there is continued support for Chavismo among an estimated 15 percent of the population. As Venezuelan sociologist Edgardo Lander notes, some of Maduro’s popular-sector support “is highly militant. There are different armed groupings within this core.”

Maduro also continues to enjoy seemingly solid support among the upper echelons of Venezuela’s military. This has frustrated US officials. An Argentine newspaper reports that US Vice President Mike Pence sharply criticized Guaidó in a recent in-person meeting in Colombia because Guaidó had told Pence half of Venezuela’s military would desert Maduro upon seeing Guaidó’s rising international support. Yet this did not occur.

Failure to recognize the messiness of Venezuela’s crisis has led to dangerous forms of magical thinking. One example of this is the “humanitarian aid” stunt pulled by the United States on February 23. The plan was to forcibly breach Venezuela’s border with the ostensible goal of delivering much-needed food and medicine. The real goal was to embarrass Maduro. Washington hoped to show that in refusing this “aid,” Maduro is a monster who does not care for his people. Never mind the blatant hypocrisy of the US offer to deliver $20 million in aid while depriving Venezuela of billions in revenue through sanctions (to say nothing of the hypocrisy of Trump’s attempt to forcibly breach another country’s border while declaring a national emergency to protect the integrity of the US border). Washington also hoped to stimulate mass defections of Venezuelan military personnel. The stunt was a failure in all respects: Virtually no aid made it to Venezuela, and there were relatively few military defections. To top it all, the UN and Red Cross refused to participate in what they correctly perceived to be a political rather than humanitarian action. (None of this is to deny the magnitude of Venezuela’s humanitarian crisis, nor the Maduro administration’s repeated and irresponsible refusal to acknowledge its severity.)

The most dangerous form of magical thinking comes from the increasingly open calls for US military intervention in Venezuela. Guaidó made such a call during the blackout, explicitly stating, “We’ll activate Article 187 when the time comes.” This refers to Article 187 of Venezuela’s Constitution, through which the National Assembly can authorize military action abroad or allow foreign military missions to enter Venezuela. US officials continue to insist that “all options are on the table,” although behind-the-scenes evidence suggests Washington has no immediate plans to engage in military action in Venezuela.

The terrible suffering that Venezuelans have experienced during the blackout provides a glimpse of the horrors that war would bring: massive damage to public infrastructure, thousands of deaths, and lasting social and psychological wounds. In a piece titled “Thinking About the Unthinkable: U.S. Military Intervention in Venezuela,” Adam Isacson of the Washington Office on Latin America estimated that if this were to happen, “Civilian casualties would probably be in the low thousands. Damage to infrastructure would total in the billions, possibly tens of billions, of dollars.” Maduro’s continued support within the military, and among a not-insignificant sector of the popular classes, some of whom are armed, indicates that a US-led or US-backed war in Venezuela could easily degenerate into a prolonged civil war.

Calls for military intervention must be rejected. One must recognize, however, the untenability of the status quo. The combination of Maduro’s repressive and inept rule and debilitating US sanctions has brought Venezuela to the edge of catastrophe. The longer the situation continues, the worse things will get. Particularly alarming are the government’s recent crackdown on journalists, reports of looting in Maracaibo Monday night, and images of desperate Caracas residents collecting water from leaking pipelines. Beyond rejecting US militarism, it is also crucial to condemn the US sanctions regime, which a small but important sector of the Democratic Party, led by California Representative Ro Khanna, has now done.

Progressives must also lay out a plausible path for resolving Venezuela’s crisis. This means thinking about what a peaceful transition might look like. It is hard to imagine how such a transition could occur without new presidential elections. Free and fair elections could not, however, occur without three important changes: a complete revamping of Venezuela’s National Electoral Council, which has lost all credibility in recent years; an end to US sanctions and the threat of war, which function as a gun to the head of the Venezuelan people, just as the Contra War did for Nicaraguans in 1990; and an end to the demonization of Chavismo, something that is occurring with increasing frequency (as seen in calls on social media for the banning of Chavista and all leftist/socialist parties). Related Article How Washington Funded the Counterrevolution in Venezuela Tim Gill and Rebecca Hanson

The only real hope for Venezuela’s future is the path of negotiations between the government and the opposition. There are several proposals for making this happen, including the International Contact Group and an earlier proposal put forward by Mexico and Uruguay. Neither is perfect. Yet both have the merit of excluding the United States as a lead actor and providing an alternative to US military intervention.

Sidelining Washington could also open up two underappreciated sources of pressure for change. The first is the possibility of an increasingly broad, multi-class domestic movement for change within Venezuela. This possibility will be blocked as long as Maduro can point to the threat of US belligerence. Removing this threat could provide space for the growth of a much broader opposition movement, one in which the voices of the popular classes could have much more weight. Sidelining Washington could also open up the possibility for increased behind-the-scenes diplomatic pressure on Maduro from other countries, such as Russia and China, which have an important degree of influence within the Maduro administration.

There is no magic bullet to fix Venezuela’s woes. The task ahead is to avoid the nightmarish scenarios of US intervention (including the continuation of the murderous sanctions regime) and an untenable status quo by opening up space within the country for peaceful, broad-based, Venezuelan-led change."	https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/venezuela-blackout-us-sanctions-maduro/
Active	"Construction on the £19bn ($24.4bn) nuclear power project started in July 2012. Main construction works for the first reactor unit of the planned four 1.4GW reactors were completed in May 2017. Nawah secured the operating license for Barakah-1 from UAE’s Federal Authority of Nuclear Regulation (FANR) in February 2020.

Nawah Energy Company, a joint venture established between ENEC and KEPCO in 2016, will be responsible for the operation and maintenance of the NPP.

The project is being jointly developed by Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation (ENEC) and the reactor supplier Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO). It is located approximately 53km west-southwest of the city of Ruwais.

The 5.6GW Barakah nuclear power plant (NPP) under-construction in the Dhafra Region of Abu Dhabi is the first nuclear power project in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as well as in the entire Arab world.

Fuel loading into the first reactor unit was completed in March 2020 and it is expected to commence operation after power ascension testing (PAT) in 2020.

The main concrete works, as well as heavy equipment lifting for the remaining three nuclear reactor units at the site, were also completed by November 2018, while construction of Barakah-2 and Barakah-3 reactor units was more than 90% complete as of March 2020.

The Barakah NPP is expected to serve a quarter of UAE’s total electricity demand while offsetting more than 21 million tonnes of greenhouse emissions a year, when fully operational.

Barakah nuclear power plant development history

The site preparation license application for the Barakah NPP was submitted to FANR in April 2010. The official groundbreaking ceremony was held in March 2011.

ENEC applied for the construction license for units 1 and 2 in December 2010 and received approval for the same from FANR in July 2012.

The construction license application for units 3 and 4 was submitted in February 2013, which was approved in September 2014.

The operating license application (OLA) for units 1 and 2 was filed in March 2015, while that for units 3 and 4 was filed in May 2017.

Barakah nuclear reactor details

The Barakah nuclear power plant will be equipped with four APR1400 reactor units of 1,400MW gross electric capacity each.

APR1400 is an advanced pressurized water reactor (PWR) based on the well-proven Korean Standard Nuclear Power Plant (KSNP) design.

Developed by the Korean nuclear industry under the leadership of KEPCO, the APR1400 technology is based on the System 80+ design, which is certified by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).

The reactor is licensed by the Korea Institute of Nuclear Safety (KINS) and has an estimated operational lifespan of 60 years.

Electricity transmission

Electricity generated from the Barakah NPP will be evacuated and fed into the UAE grid by Abu Dhabi Transmission and Despatch Company (TRANSCO).

ENEC signed a connection and interface agreement for the same with TRANSCO in February 2016.

Barakah NPP financing

Financial closure for the £19bn ($24.4bn) nuclear power plant was achieved in October 2016. The project is being financed through 80% debt and 20% equity.

The debt financing comprises £13.3bn ($16.2bn) of direct loan from the Abu Dhabi government and a £2bn ($2.5bn) loan facility from the Export-Import Bank of Korea (KEXIM).

Contractors involved with the Barakah nuclear power plant

A consortium led by KEPCO was awarded a £12.8 ($20.4bn) contract for the design, construction, and operation of four APR1400 reactor units at the Barakah NPP in December 2009.

The other members of the consortium include Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP), Hyundai, Samsung, Doosan, Korea Power Engineering Company (KOPEC), Korea Nuclear Fuel (KNF), and Korea Plant Service and Engineering (KPS).

KHNP is responsible for the operating support services and co-operative businesses, while KEPCO Engineering & Construction (KEPCO E&C) was subcontracted for the plant design, architecture, and engineering works.

Bechtel was engaged to provide design and project management support services to KEPCO E&C.

Doosan is in charge of the construction and management of the nuclear steam supply system (NSSS), steam generator, and other related components.

Hyundai and Samsung were entrusted with the civil engineering works, while Westinghouse was subcontracted for providing technical assistance and license-related works.

The nuclear fuel for the Barakah NPP will be supplied by KNF and maintained by KPS.

Hilal Bil Badi and Partners Contracting (HILALCO), a local company, was awarded the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contract for the critical water intake structures of the plant.

Other major local firms involved with the project include Emirates Steel, National Cement, Dubai Cable Company, National Marine Dredging Company, and Western Bainoona Group.

Nawah Energy signed a ten-year operation and maintenance (O&M) framework agreement with EDF for the Barakah NPP, in November 2018."	https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/projects/barakah-nuclear-power-plant-abu-dhabi/
Active	"Rampal power plant

'But I’m still fighting to make a living, and passing a miserable life staying under the open sky'

A group of environmental activists and experts has urged the government to stop building the 1,320 megawatt coal-fired Rampal Power Plant for the greater sake of the Sundarbans and the people living in and around the mangrove forest.

Putting emphasis on renewable energy instead, they observed that a number of such under construction, and proposed coal-fired power plants, appeared as environmental threats to the localities surrounding the respective sites.

They made the remarks while addressing a public hearing on “development, displacement, human rights, and ecological destruction” organized by ALRD, ActionAID, BAPA, TIB and Water Keeper Bangladesh at the Liberation War Museum auditorium in Dhaka yesterday.

The victims of Matarbari coal-fired power plant, and the 2016 Gobindaganj eviction drive, among others, placed their testimonies at the hearing.

Prof Anu Muhammad, who is leading a movement to save the Sundarbans, said development projects like the power plants are definitely helping economic growth, but causing havoc to the environment, and local people.

“Development is underway by damaging the natural forces of the Sundarbans,” he said, adding that the projects are destroying the environment.

“They (the government) are prioritizing foreign states, instead of thinking about the masses,” he furthered.

The plant is only 14 kilometre north of the world's largest mangrove forest, he mentioned.

Echoing similar sentiments, rights activist and eminent citizen Sultana Kamal urged the government not to destroy the environment and nature on the pretext of any development activities.

Claiming that the government did not take opinions from the locals while planning the coal-fired power plant in Matarbari of Cox’s Bazar, she demanded compensations for those evicted from the project site.

As construction of the plant advanced a lot, she urged the government to proceed for the next phases of the project taking opinion from locals, and experts.

Rights Activist Khushi Kabir alleged that the project victims did not only lose their own land, but are also facing torture.

No govt representative was present

Despite being invited, not a single government representative attended the hearing, causing an uproar with the participants including the organizers, and the project victims.

Anu Muhammad said this act of the government proved how much it does care about the people.

Expressing resentment over the issue, Sultana Kamal said: “By avoiding the event, the government proved that it does not believe in the process of accountability.""

Nur Alam Sheikh, a resident of Rampal upazila of Bagerhet where the 1320-MW plant is being built, said they were promised proper rehabilitation, jobs, and compensation while being evicted from the site.

“But I’m still fighting to make a living, and passing a miserable life staying under the open sky,” he said.

He also said that the government should fulfill its pledges.

Another Rampal resident Kamal Sarkar said: “We want electricity and other development, but not at the cost of our environment.”

Priscila Marmu, who is among those evicted in Gobindaganj upazila of Gaibandha in the name of recovering land for a sugar mill, said the local administration had pledged employment for the evicted families in the facility, but it never materialized.

“We were told that the government would employ 70% of us in the mill, but outsiders were appointed there,” she maintained."	https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/nation/2019/11/30/environmentalists-stand-against-rampal-power-plant

Active	"Power Construction Corporation of China (PowerChina), the parent company of Sinohydro Corporation, has delivered a Power Plant Pre-feasibility Assessment Report (PFS) to UK-based mining and energy company GCM Resources (GCM) for the construction of additional power plants in Bangladesh.

The report is for further mine-mouth coal-fired power plants at the Phulbari coal and power project site.

In September this year, GCM appointed Sinohydro to conduct a pre-feasibility study and other due diligence for the proposed power plants.

These plants would have the capacity to generate up to 4,000MW at the Phulbari site.

The PFS suggests 6,000MW can be generated from the mine’s thermal coal production ‘using the latest high energy-efficient Ultra-Super Critical power plant design’.



“This is a significant step for the Phulbari Coal and Power Project as it confirms that technically the project is able to support 6,000MW of power generation.”

The new power plants in Bangladesh will be in addition to the existing 2,000MW power plant proposal with China Gezhouba Group International Engineering (CGGC).

GCM executive chairman Datuk Michael Tang said: “This is a significant step for the Phulbari Coal and Power Project as it confirms that technically the project is able to support 6,000MW of power generation.

“Subject to satisfactory negotiations, we aim to extend the arrangement with PowerChina and then for more detailed feasibility studies to be completed on the proposed mine-mouth power plants, which we anticipate will provide energy at the lowest-cost in Bangladesh.

“We are confident that with the support of such high calibre development partners the Phulbari Coal and Power Project will deliver substantial benefits for the government, the people of Bangladesh and our shareholders.”

GCM noted that these power plants are expected to be commissioned in line with the coal mine’s ramp up to full production."	https://www.power-technology.com/news/powerchina-power-plants-in-bangladesh/

(SBPL), a partnership between Meralco PowerGen (MGen) and New Growth BV, a wholly owned subsidiary of Electricity Generating Public Co. Ltd. (Egco Group) of Thailand, is constructing a 500-megawatt (MW) supercritical coal-fired power plant in Mauban, Quezon.

Egco, in its management discussion analysis, said the construction of the project has progressed 97.38 percent and the commercial operation date is scheduled in the fourth quarter of 2019. The electricity to be generated by the plant will be sold to Meralco, the country’s largest distribution utility, under a 20-year power supply agreement. This project would bring in additional revenues to Meralco in 2020. Of the plant’s capacity and energy, 455 MW are contracted to Meralco, pursuant to a power supply agreement extendable for up to an additional five years. The SBPL power plant will play a crucial role as electricity demand grows, especially in Luzon, which accounts for about 70 percent of the country’s gross domestic product. The company tapped the consortium of Daelim Industrial Co. Ltd. and Mitsubishi Corp. as the EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) contractor for the project.

SBPL achieved financial close for the power project in December 2015 for a total debt of P42.1 billion. SBPL also proposed to develop and construct a dedicated point-to-point facility, which will connect the coal plant to the Luzon grid through the Tayabas substation of the National Grid Corp. of the Philippines (NGCP) by connecting to the existing Quezon Power Philippines Limited Co. connection asset, comprised of the Mauban substation and a 230-kilovolt transmission line. This dedicated facility will cost P242,956,734.

The committee approved a proposal of the Power Division to allow a consortium of three companies -- United Enterprise and Co Ltd from Bangladeshi and two from China -- to establish the 590MW combined cycle power plant in Anwara, Chittagong

The Cabinet Committee on Public Purchase on Wednesday approved a total of six proposals, including one to set up a 590MW power plant in Chittagong under the private sector.

New Finance Minister AHM Mustafa Kamal presided over the maiden meeting of the new committee after the formation of the government following Awami League's victory in December 30’s general election, reports UNB.

After the meeting, Mustafa Kamal briefed reporters on the outcome of the meeting.

The committee approved a proposal of the Power Division to allow a consortium of three companies -- United Enterprise and Co Ltd from Bangladeshi and two from China -- to establish the 590MW combined cycle power plant in Anwara, Chittagong.

As per the proposal, the plant will be run with natural gas or imported re-liquefied natural gas (RLNG).

State-owned Bangladesh Power Development Board (PDB) will purchase electricity from the plant for over 22 years at a levelized tariff of $0.037 per unit (kilowatt hour) which is equivalent to Tk2.95 when it will be running with natural gas.

But the tariff will be charged at $0.06, equivalent to Tk5.44, per unit when it will be running using imported RLNG.

Another proposal of the Power Division to install 150,575 pre-paid metres by December 2019 in Comilla and Mymensingh regions also received approval of the committee.

Chinese firm Shenzhen Star Instrument Co. Ltd (Sh.Star) won the contract at Tk132.49 crore.

Of the total pre-paid metres, 70,250 will be installed in the Comilla region while 80,325 in the Mymensingh region.

The committee approved a proposal of the Energy Division to import a total of 1.420 million tonnes of different types of petroleum fuel from different countries under the government-to-government contracts in six months from January to June.

The government has to spend about Tk6772.87 crore to import this petroleum.

A proposal of the Railways Ministry received the nod of the committee to appoint a consultant for a project to construct single-line dual-gauge railway tracks from Dohazari to Cox's Bazar via Ramu and Ramu to Ghundum in Bandarban.

A local firm, Development Design Consultant Ltd, won the contract at Tk38.57 crore for management consultancy services of the project.

The committee also approved a tender proposal to award a contract to widen the Alenga-Jamalpur Highway at a cost of Tk101.96 crore.

The order for setting up the 3x800 MW Patratu Super Thermal Power Station Expansion, Phase-I (3x 800 MW) has been placed on BHEL by Patratu Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Limited (PVUNL - a subsidiary of NTPC Ltd. in Joint Venture with Jharkhand Bijli Vitran Nigam Limited).

Significantly, this is the single largest order ever placed by NTPC or its subsidiaries and the second largest order ever won by BHEL. Located at Patratu in Ramgarh district of Jharkhand, the project will be executed by BHEL on Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) basis.

The project will significantly contribute to the nationâ€™s quest for clean and eco-friendly power in multiple ways. It will reduce fuel consumption by employing high efficiency equipment working at higher operating parameters. The commissioning of the project would also lead to phasing out of the old fleet of sub-critical units presently installed at Patratu, enabling a quantum leap in efficiency of the station.

The project will further limit emissions by utilizing state-of-the-art Flue Gas Desulphurization (FGD) and Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems to capture pollutants like SOx and NOx. Significantly, the project is the largest of its kind in the country to be based on Air Cooled Condenser technology, which will result in conserving a large amount of water.

BHEL has been a major partner in the power development programme of Jharkhand and is also currently executing the 3x660 MW North Karanpura Super Thermal Power Station located in Chatra district. Significantly, over 80% of the installed power generating capacity in the state of Jharkhand is equipped with BHEL sets.

Key equipment for the project will be manufactured at BHELâ€™s Trichy, Haridwar, Hyderabad, Ranipet, Bhopal, Bengaluru and Jhansi plants, while the company's Power Sector â€“ Western Region division will be responsible for construction and installation activities at the site.

BHEL is the leading power equipment manufacturer with 56 sets of supercritical boilers and 49 sets of supercritical turbine generators ordered on it so far, by various customers in the domestic as well as overseas markets.

Background on Units 1 & 2

The Barapukuria Coal Power Plant is an existing 250 megawatt (MW) coal-fired power station which is owned and operated by the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) in Dudhipur, Dinajpur province in Bangladesh.[1] Currently the plant has two 125 MW units, but operators are seeking to add an additional 250 MW unit.

The plant was commissioned in 2006 and consumes approximately 450,000 tonnes of coal a year which is supplied by the nearby Barapukuria coal mine.[2][3] In its 2011-12 annual report BPDB states that the cost of coal was 354.63 crore Taka. [3.5 billion taka = approx $US44.9 million at July 2013][4] and that the plant had a load factor of 58%.[1]

Unit 3 Expansion

Barapukuria's Unit 3 is a proposed 250 megawatt expansion of the existing plant. The expansion of the power station is listed by the BPDB as having been approved by the Cabinet ""Purchase Committee"" with a nominal commissioning date of March 2016.[5] [6]

In 2012, the Bangladesh Power Development Board reported that no progress had been made on the project despite three extensions of the notice for submission of tender for the plant.[7]

In October 2015, it was reported that construction work on the project had begun. The report listed the plant at 275 MW and stated that it would consume 600,000 tonnes of coal annually, with 75 percent coming from Barapukuria Coal Mining Company.[8] Commissioning is planned for 2018.[9][10]

On December 3, 2017, it was reported the new unit was undergoing testing and would be completed soon.[11] In April 2018 it was reported that ""development work"" on the unit would continue through the end of the year.[12] The unit was reported to be operating in July 2018.[13]

Coal shortages

In July 2018 the plant's three units were shut down due to coal shortages from the nearby Barapukuria Coal Mining Company Ltd (BCMCL). Allegations have been raised that coal has been sold illegally by the government, since there are no technical reasons for the shortage.[13] The plant resumed producing power in September, with the ""disappearance"" of 142,000 tons of coal still a mystery.[14]

Financing

In January 2014, Chinese private bank Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) provided Bangladesh with a loan of US$224 million to increase the capacity of the 250MW Barapukuria coal-fired thermal power station by 275 MW. The remainder of the estimated cost of the US$330.52 million project was to be funded by the Bangladeshi government.[15]

Matarbari coal-fired power plant make-up

Matarbari thermal power plant will be developed on a 1,500-acre site. It will consist of two thermal units based on ultra-supercritical coal-fired technology, with an installed capacity of 600MW each.

Each of the two units will consist of a steam-based pulverised coal-fired boiler unit, a 600MW steam turbine and a 750MVA steam generator. The plant will feature a 275m-high flue gas stack and an electrostatic precipitator, which will limit the particulate emissions to 100mg/Nm³.

The power plant will require 180,000m³/h of water, which will be provided by a reverse osmosis (RO) desalination plant. The RO plant will draw water from the Bay of Bengal, which is located on the western side of the project site.

""Matarbari thermal power plant will be developed on a 1,500-acre site.""

Infrastructure for the power plant

A new deep-sea port facility named Matarbari Port will be developed for importing the coal required for the power plant. The port will include a 760m-long container and a multi-purpose terminal.

The port terminal will include a fuel berth, a fuel transportation facility, and two coal-handling jetties. The channel length will be 14km, width will be 250m and maximum depth will be approximately 18.5m.

A new 400kV transmission line will be developed to transmit the electricity generated by the power plant to the national grid.

Coal supply for Matarbari power plant

The power plant is expected to require 3.73 million tonnes (Mt) of coal a year, which will be imported from Indonesia, Australia and South Africa through the Matarbari Port.

A coal unloading system equipped with rail-mounted continuous bucket type unloaders will transport the imported coal to the power plant.

Financing

Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) provided an Official Development Assistance (ODA) loan of ¥10.74bn ($90m) for the project, in June 2014. The ODA loan has a repayment period of 30 years and grace period of ten years.

JICA awarded another ODA loan worth ¥2.65bn ($20m) to the Government of Bangladesh in June 2018 for the development of the Matarbari port.

Active	"The challenging task of importing good quality (i.e., high calorie, low ash, low moisture and low sulfur) coal from international market to feed Barapukuria coal-fired power plant in Dinajpur has started. The plant with its three units has a cumulative installed capacity of producing 525 megawatt (MW) power. The first two units (2 x 125 MW) started its commercial operation in 2015 while the third unit (1 x 275 MW) started its operations later. The power plant is designed exclusively to use coal of 'Barapukuria grade' (high calorie, low sulfur and low ash coal). If run in full capacity, it should require 5,200 tonnes of coal daily.

The Barapukuria coal mine is the only source of supply for the coal mine mouth power plant (the only coal-fired thermal power plant in the country so far). The underground Barapukuria coal mine is designed to produce one million tonnes of coal annually (less than 3,500 tonnes a day on an average). The initial mine development plan included 250 MW power plant feed (70 per cent of the mine's target productions) and the remaining bulk of coal was planned to be supplied (nearly one-third of its productions) to local consumers (like the brick manufacturers). But with the inclusion of the third unit (275 MW) at the Barapukuria power plant a few months back, selling coal to the local market has become impossible (assuming that the power plant will consume more than it was required for the total daily productions). However, coal sale continued from the mine yard and at one point the yard became empty. This happened coincidentally when the mine temporarily had to shut its productions due to technical reasons and the Barapukuria thermal power plant desperately required to continue its power generation to meet the increased power demand in the northern region.

The published reports suggest that the Barapukuria coal mine produced approximately 1,01,66,000 tonnes of coal between 2005 and June 29 this year. Of the produced volume, 66,87,000 tonnes were supplied to the mine mouth power plant for generating power. Besides, 33,19,000 tonnes of coal were sold to different organisations and brick kilns. The mine authorities took another 12,000 tonnes for their own use.

So, there should have been a stock of 148,000 tonnes of coal at the 17-acre mine yard. But it was found in the mid July that the mine yard has only 3,000 tonnes of coal stock. It was further reported that no inventory audit for coal production and selling was done since the Barapukuria coal mine commenced its operations back in 2005. The technical system loss, if any, was not recorded. The Barapukuria power plant had to be shut down on July 22 due to unavailability or no supply of coal. Electricity supply in the country's northern region was severely hampered as the power plant was shut down. The government later initiated investigations into the mismanagement.

Steps have been taken to resume coal mine productions but production arrangements underground will not be ready until mid-September. Accompanied with all the textbook mining challenges, the underground Barapukuria coal mine has suffered from production interruptions on several occasions. Apart from technical limitations, the mine suffered a few months back from a non-stop labour strikes for a few weeks. It is, therefore, obvious that from the single source of Barapukuria mine, coal supply to the power plant at the mine mouth could face challenges.

Despite that common knowledge, Barapukuria coal power plant installed its third unit without having alternative coal supply chain. The three power plant units, if run uninterrupted, are destined to face coal supply interruptions as the mine productions and the power plant fuel demands thoroughly mismatch. Hence, the shortfall has to be met by imports. It was simply obvious, but Barapukuria coal-fired thermal power plant authority did not arrange any alternative source of coal supply.

Under the circumstances, Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) floated tenders for purchasing 100,000 tonnes of coal from international market for the Barapukuria coal-fired thermal power plant in mid-August. The interested bidders are expected to respond and submit their bids within August for supplying coal under certain conditions at the power plant site. BPDB expects that the tender evaluation, contract negotiations and 100,000 tonnes of coal supply activities should be completed within December this year.

Supplying coal from the international market to Barapukuria power plant site is, however, a challenging task. None of the country's ports are ready to handle a large volume of coal import. There is no river route and rail link that can allow easy transportation of coal from the country's sea ports. Several transshipments of coal is inevitable involving coal loss, high transportation and handling cost to transport coal even inside the country. It is also challenging to accomplish coal transportation activities maintaining a very tight schedule. All these factors will make the imported coal significantly expensive compared to the cost of coal from the mine supply. BPDB is now faced with the challenge of importing as well as supplying coal to the Barapukuria power plant at a reasonable price.

Active	"The Rampal power station, also known as the Maitree Super Thermal Power Project, is a proposed 1320-megawatt (MW) coal-fired power station at Rampal in Khulna division, Bangladesh. It is sponsored by the Bangladesh-India Friendship Power Company (BIFPCL), a 50-50 joint project of the governments of Bangladesh and India.[1]

Although also known as the Khulna South power station, the plant is different from the Orion Group's Khulna power station (Orion).

Background (Phase I)

The Rampal power station would involve the government acquiring 2000 acres of farm land to install the plant under a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between Bangladesh`s Power Development Board (PDB) and India`s state-owned National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) in August 2010; they have been designated to implement the project by 2016.[4]

On January 29, 2012, the India Power Development Board (PDB) signed an agreement with NTPC to build the 1,320-megawatt Rampal plant. The PDB and the NTPC will implement the $1.5 billion project on a 50:50 equity basis. The NTPC will set up and operate the plant.[5]

According to a July 2014 report, the project will start commercial generation by December 2018.[6] Three companies – Marubeni Corporation from Japan, Harbin Electric International Company from China and Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited from India – have submitted bids to construct the project. The contract is planned to be awarded by January 2016.[7]

In July 2016 Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL) was awarded the contract to build the plant, at an estimated cost of US$1.68 billion. BHEL has until July 2019 to have the power plant installed and ready for operations. BHEL won the tender at the beginning of this year but, according to local media sources, the official signing of the deal dragged on to July due to BHEL holding out for exemptions from taxes and duties as well as from the mandatory insurance process. Negotiations are also reportedly under way between the project promoters and Coal India on the supply of 4 million tonnes of Indian coal per year to fuel the plant.[8]

According to local images, work at the site was underway in March 2016. UNESCO has urged Bangladesh to cancel the coal plant, saying it endangers the nearby Sundarbans.[9]

In April 2017 it was reported that construction on the project had begun, and will take an estimated 41 months. Groups continue to oppose the plant.[10] The construction report followed the Ex-Im Bank of India confirming its US$1.6bn loan for the plant.[11] India-owned BHEL received the US$1.5 billion order to build the Rampal Power Plant.[12]

In March 2018 work progress was reported to be ""just 5 percent"", with the plant planned for operation in 2022.[13] Planet satellite photos from December 2017 to December 2018 shows land clearing appears complete and preliminary construction work has begun.

In September 2018, a 17-year-old worker was electrocuted at the project site.[14] In March 2019, two workers were killed and one was critically injured in an accident at the site.[15]

In June 2019, BIFPCL began taking bids for coal delivery for the plant. Company officials said coal for the plant would be sourced from Indonesia, South Africa, and Australia.[16]

In May 2020, 400 Indian citizens working at the Rampal plant staged a demonstration. The workers said they were being deprived of decent quality food and were not paid in full, and could not return to India due to the countrywide shutdown. Currently, 1802 foreigners are working at the power station, including 1344 Indian workers.[17]

In July 2020, it was reported in Bangladeshi media that the coronavirus pandemic was contributing to the construction of the Rampal plant running far behind schedule at only 50% complete and significantly over-budget. [18]

Background (Phase II)

The sponsors have anticipated a potential second phase for the project, comprising an additional 2 x 660 MW units. No date has been specified for the second phase.[19]

In October 2016, in response to widespread public opposition and global pressure, officials within the power ministry began making statements that they would pursue natural gas and renewables over coal. Plans for the Phase II of the project appear to be on hold or cancelled.

Agreements

In August 2010, a 'Memorandum of Understanding was signed between Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) and India's state-owned National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) in which they agreed to implement the project by 2016.[20] On January 29, 2012, the Bangladesh Power Development Board signed an agreement with NTPC to build the plant.[21] The joint venture company is known as Bangladesh India Friendship Power Company (BIFPC).[22] The BPDB and the NTPC agreed to implement the project on a 50:50 equity basis. The NTPC will set up and operate the plant.[23] Bangladesh and India will equally share up to 30 per cent of the equity of this project. The remainder of the equity, which might be equivalent to USD 1.5 billion, will be taken as bank loans with help from the NTPC. According to the sources in the Bangladesh Power Division, the joint venture company will enjoy a 15-year tax holiday.[24]

Financing

Loans are expected to fund up to 70% of the US$1.5 billion project, while India and Bangladesh will fund the remaining 30% equally (15% each). However, the Bangladesh Planning Commission refused approval, saying the project was not compliant with the country’s existing policy nor was the funding and ownership of the plant clear. This leaves even the 15% Bangladesh stake in the project uncertain.[25]

In 2014-2015 French banks Crédit Agricole, BNP Paribas, and Société Génerale said they would not fund the Rampal power station, after sustained public opposition to the project over its social and environmental effects.[25]

In December 2014, the council on ethics of Norway released its assessment of the country’s government pension fund global’s investment, valued at US$56 million, in the thermal plant. It recommended the fund exclude the project from its portfolio “due to an unacceptable risk of the company contributing to severe environmental damage”. In March 2015 the Guardian reported that the Norweigan pension fund would likely pull funding from the Rampal plant.[26]

In April 2017 the Ex-Im Bank of India confirmed it is providing a US$1.6 billion loan to Bangladesh-India Friendship Power Company (BIFPCL) for development of the Rampal coal plant.[11]

Economic Analysis

According to a 2016 report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, the Rampal power station will produce electricity that will cost 32% more than the average electricity costs in Bangladesh, despite multiple subsidies from Bangladesh and India. The financial think tank argues the project amounts to US$3 billion in public subsidies: ""First, a below-market-rate loan by Indian EXIM Bank represents a US$988m subsidy effectively paid by Indian taxpayers to Bangladeshi consumers. Second, the Bangladesh government is proposing a 15-year income tax exemption for the plant, an exemption worth US$936m. Third, Bangladesh would be granting an effective annual US$26m subsidy by conducting maintenance dredging to assure coal delivery to the plant.""[27]

Environmental issues

It has been alleged that the Rampal station is against The Ramsar Convention because the plant is to be built in a forest and sensitive wetlands area. The Ramsar Convention is the only global environmental treaty that deals with preservation of wetlands. Bangladesh signed the convention in 1992.[28]

The plant will need to import 4.72 million tons of coal per year. This massive freight will need about 59 ships each having 80,000-ton capacity that would be taken to the port on the bank of Poshur river. The 40 kilometers from the port to the plant cuts through the Sundarbans and it includes the river flow path. Environmentalists claim these coal-carrying vehicles are not often covered as they scatter large amounts of fly ash, coal dust and sulfur, and other toxic chemicals are released through the entire life of the project. The predictions made by environment and ecology experts are that the plant will release various toxic gases such as carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen and sulphur dioxide, thereby putting the surrounding areas and, most importantly, Sundarban at grave risk.[29]

According to a report published in New Age, in past few years the Indian central and state authorities which deal with environmental concerns in India denied the proposal of NTPC to set up a similar coal-fired thermal power plant at Gajmara in Gadarwara of Madhya Pradesh for a number of reasons. NTPC failed to get approval of the Indian Central Green Panel (Green Tribunal) in 2010 for the construction of that coal-fired thermal power plant because a vast portion of agricultural land would have been impacted. Similar issues exist with the Rampal project.[30]

Government response

The Bangladesh government has rejected the allegations that the coal-based power plant would adversely impact the world’s largest mangrove forest. The energy adviser of the Bangladeshi prime minister said that the controversy over the power plant and its impact on the Sundarbans was “not based on facts”. He has also stated that the plant will not negatively affect the mangrove forest because the emission of greenhouse gas will be kept at the minimum level. The government also stated they will import high quality coal, build a 275 metre high chimney, employ state-of-the art technology and other steps to keep its impact on the Sundarbans at a negligible level.[31]

Opposition

Political opposition

On March 1, 2011, a High Court bench asked the government why the construction of the plant should not be declared illegal. The senior BNP leader also claimed that acquiring 4,000 acres of land in the area beside the Pashur River, mostly arable, would be environmentally disastrous. High Court lawyer Manzill Murshid stated during the hearing that the government was planning to acquire 1,834 acres of land.[32][33]

The National Committee on Protection of Oil, Gas, Mineral Resources, and Power-Port, environmentalist groups, bodies of the left-leaning parties and general people of Bangladesh vowed to resist the planned inauguration of the Rampal Power Plant scheduled on 22 October 2013.[34] On September 24, 2013 thousands of people in Bangladesh began a rally for 5 days and 400 kilometers to oppose the power plant. Their march began in the capital city of Dhaka and moved towards the Sundarbans.

In India too there has been some fragmented opposition of the power plant. In his interview with Siddharth Sivakumar of the Indian cultural website Tinpahar, Shayan Chowdhury Arnob said on this issue, ""The Rampal Power Plant might become the biggest Power Plant, but it would cost the world its largest mangrove forest, the Sundarbans. Sundarbans has its life in numerous intertwined organic chains. When a chain is broken everything would fall apart, one after the other. Money has nothing to do with development or happiness; it's about our attitude to life.""[35]

Citizen opposition

Environmental experts have expressed concerns that the proposed plant at Rampal in Bagerhat could destroy Sundarban, one of the world’s largest mangrove forests. Faridul Islam, chief coordinator of Save the Sundarbans, pointed out that the selected location of the project was only nine kilometres from Sundarban. About 2.5 million people depend on the Sundarban region, such as wood-cutters, fishermen, and honey gatherers. An official said the Power Development Board would submit an environment impact assessment report to the Bangladesh environment department.[36]

On July 9, 2011, the police foiled protests at two places in Rampal upazila in the Bagerhat district demanding cancellation of the proposed plant near Sundarban. The police arrested two participants. Five organizations active in the country’s south-western region at a joint news conference at Khulna Press Club demanded immediate exemplary punishment of the policemen involved, saying the police engaged in attacks against the protestors.[37]

On July 18, 2011, the BNP acting secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir asked the government to shelve the proposed coal project at Rampal in Bagerhat, fearing that it might harm the Sundarbans. He also expressed solidarity with the locals who had been protesting the government move to set up the 1300MW plant at Satmari Katakhali of the upazila in collaboration with NTPC, which will use Indian coal that contains high sulphur.[38]

In April 2013 environmentalists rejected an environment impact assessment report on the proposed plant, saying it did not take into account prior studies showing the project would have a large negative impact on the environment.[39]

In March 2016 an estimated 1,000 Bangladeshis began a four-day, 250-kilometer march from the capital to the Sundarbans in opposition to the plant.[40]

On July 28, 2016, police using barricades, teargas shells, and batons blocked a ""Save the Sundarbans"" march toward the Prime Minister's Office. Six people were arrested. The protest was organized in response to the signing of an agreement to build the coal plant in the world's largest mangrove forest. Two layers of police barricades were dismantled by protesters before police deployed teargas shells and charged the demonstrators with clubs. According to Baki Billah, former president of Bangladesh Chhatra Union, 16 activists were hospitalised.[41]

2015 report raises human rights concerns

A fact-finding mission by South Asians for Human Rights found numerous flaws in the environmental impact statement and resettlement process for the proposed 1320 MW power station. The investigation also found that local people and activists “have been constantly harassed by powerful quarters through threats, intimidation, assaults and filing of false cases.”[42]

Background on Kalapara power station

On its website, North-West Power Generation describes the Kalapara project as being set up in two phases. The first phase is referred to as the ""Payra 1320 (2x660) MW Thermal Power Plant Project."" The second phase is referred to as the ""Barguna / Patuakhali 1320 (2x660) MW Ultra Supercritical Coal Based Thermal Power Plant Project (2nd Phase)."" Note that Patuakhali and Barguna are adjacent districts and Payra (Paira) is located in close proximity.[1][2][3]

Background on Payra power station

In March 2014 the state-owned North-West Power Generation Company (a subsidiary of Bangladesh Power Development Board) and CMC -- China National Machinery Import & Export (Group) Corporation -- signed a Memorandum of Understanding to build a 1320 MW coal plant in Kalapara upazila of Patuakhali. The project will be located on the Rabnabad river bank near Paira Bandar. The estimated cost is $2 billion.[4]

According to the website of Bangladesh's North-West Power Generation Co Ltd. (December 2017), construction on the project is underway.[5]

Unit 1 is planned to come online in April 2019, and unit 2 in October 2019.[6][7]

In March 2018 it was reported that 35 percent of work on the plant had been completed.[8] In May 2018, NWPGCL reported the project was 42% complete.[9] In October 2018 it was reported the plant was on track for commissioning in 2019.[10] In November 2018 the project was reported to be 55% complete.[11]

As of April 2019, construction was 70% complete, which was significantly behind the company's original schedule. Builders blamed the delay on a ""lack of coordination among stakeholders,"" and especially on delays in building the transmission line, completion of which had at that point been pushed back to August 2020.[12]

In May 2019, BCPCL announced that it would be signing a coal supply deal in June with Indonesian coal importer PT Bayan Resources. The company also announced that Unit 1 was scheduled to be completed in December 2019, and Unit 2 in June 2020.[13][14]

Planet satellite photos from January 2017 to November 2019 show construction progress.

According to BCPCL (November 2019), unit 1 is completed but the transmission facilities are not ready yet. Due to this, the power station is now planned for operation in 2020.[15] Test production at the plant began on January 13, 2020.[16]

In February 2020, the India-based Business Standard reported that commercial commissioning of the plant was experiencing delays due to the Coronavirus. According to the acting managing director of Bangladesh-China Power Company Limited: ""We cannot do the post-test-run maintenance as some workers are stuck in China in the wake of the coronavirus epidemic.""[17]

According to New Age of Bangladesh, the main issue facing the commissioning of the plant is the lack of adequate transmission: ""In the test run, the first unit of the plant could never reach its full generation capacity because of low capacity transmission line,"" according to Payra project director Shah Abdul Moula.[18]

In May 2020, Dhaka Tribune reported that Unit 1 started commercial operation.[19]

The project is sponsored by Bangladesh-China Power Company Limited (BCPCL), a 50:50 JV between China National Machinery Import and Export Corp and Bangladesh's North-West Power Generation Co Ltd, which was established on 28 August 2007 as a Public Limited Company under the Bangladesh Power Development Board.[6]

CMC, or China National Machinery Import & Export (Group) Corporation, was established in 1950, and in 1998 it became a subsidiary of China General Technology (Group) Holding Co. Ltd., a state-owned enterprise.[20] CMC has established overseas subsidiaries in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Turkey, and Luxembourg.[21]

Financing

In June 2014 it was reported that Bangladesh's largest bilateral donor, Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), would bankroll the plant by partially providing nearly US$3.7 billion worth of loans in some few tranches.[2]

However, in October 2014 it was reported that BCPCL will provide 30% of the funds for the project, and mobilize the other 70% from international sources. The project has an estimated cost of US$2 billion.[22]

In April 2016 BCPCL said it will invest $1.56 billion into the plant. It will fund 80 percent of the investment by a loan from Chinese banks.[6]

In October 2016 the government approved a US$1.9 billion loan from the China Exim Bank for the project.[23]

Background

In June 2012 the Bangladesh Power Development Board signed three agreements with Orion Power to set up three private coal-fired power plants in Khulna, Chittagong and Mawa, Bangladesh totaling 1,200 megawatt capacity. It was reported the Chittagong power station (Orion) would have a generating capacity of 282.67 MW.[1][2]

In April 2013 it was reported that the Chittagong project would be merged with Orion's 283 MW Khulna power station (Orion) into a single 565 MW plant at Khulna.[3]

Active	"The proposed imported coal-fired power plant in Banshkhali of Chittagong is set to become the biggest private sector investment in the country’s power sector. A joint venture of Bangladesh’s S Alam Group, and China’s SEPCO-3 Electric Power Constitution Corporation and HTG Group will build the thermal power plant with a net capacity of 1,224MW at a cost of $2.4bn. But as reported in the Dhaka Times on 13 May 2016, the Gondamara union (ward) in Chittagong’s Banshkhali has become a prison as the police continue to lay siege and cordon off the area. “The [Banshkhali power plant] project started with fraud, falsity and criminal activities against the Banshkhali people, while the local conglomerate S Alam group started grabbing 1,700 acres of government khash (public) land in the name of the project,” said Prof. Anu Muhammad, secretary of the National Committee to Protect Oil, Gas, Mineral Resources, Power and Ports. “Bangladesh is getting sliced to fulfil the interests of other countries. India is in Rampal (another coal power station) to create its strategic power, while Russia is in Rooppur nuclear power plant, USA is capturing the Bay of Bengal and now China is in Banshkhali coal-based power plant in the name of creating a special economic zone in Bangladesh.” He added that the electricity crisis cannot be solved with destructive projects like Banshkhali and Rampal coal-based power plants, and Rooppur nuclear power plant project. Panic has gripped the locals of Gondamara union in Banshkhali upazila as police continued to raid the area in May 2016. Locals claimed that the raids were being conducted to foil their movement against the move to install a coal-fired power plant there. Police, however, claimed that they were conducting the drives to arrest the accused in different cases and recover illegal arms in the upazila. Police checkpoints were being set up at Time Bazar in Shil Kup, Harun Bazar in Saral and Bangla Bazar in Chambal, virtually confining the villagers, they claimed. Other than children and very elderly people, most male members in the area are now on the run fearing arrest after the events of 4th April 2016. “No one is paying heed to our problems. What is going on in the union? They [police] have turned the whole union into a jail. Now, no one can go outside the union,” claimed Abu Ahmed, a close aide of Liakat Ali, convener of the Committee to Protect Habitations and Graveyards (Daily Star, 19 May 2016). Fear of environment pollution and other hazards, if the power plant was installed, prompted the people of Gondamara area of Banshkhali to go for agitation. The locals alleged that some people in favour of S Alam Group forced them to sell their land to the group. Mosharraf Hossain, an Imam of a mosque in Chittagong city and resident of Gondamara, said that there were several hundred homesteads in the area where S Alam Group was trying to set up the coal-fired power plant. ‘We will not be able to live there if the power plant is set up. Our household, arable land and salt processing fields would be damaged due to the pollution if the plant was set up,’ said Mosharraf. Meanwhile, Hanif, an honours student of Chittagong College and resident of the village, said S Alam Group engaged some paid brokers to grab local people’s land. The brokers forced local people to sell their land at lower price. They threatened us when we did not agree to sell our land,’ said Hanif. (New Age, 6 April 2016). The Land Office gave its clearance to S Alam Group to buy 3,000 acres of land, terming the acquired land as “barren land”; this is a baseless claim, the land is used for rice farming and for salt production. Protesters follow the lead of the ""Committee to protect habitation and graveyards"", implying that some of the land is sacred. See more On 4th April 2016 at least four people were killed. A few days later the local population of Banshkhali agitating against the proposed coal power plant by S Alam Group issued an ultimatum asking the authorities to scrap the project. Liakat Ali, convener of the Homestead and Graveyard Protection Committee, made the announcement from a condolence rally held on the West Gondamara Primary School premises to pay respect to the four protesters killed and to the many people injured by police and goons. “I want to make it clear that this is not a movement of any political party. Rather, it is the movement of the people. I urge the prime minister to give a second thought to the proposed project before the problem deepens. Please resolve the problem without further delay,” said Liakat, who is also the former chairman of Gondamara union (ward). (Dhaka Times, 8 April 2016). Monowwar Islam, secretary of the government’s power division, said Bangladesh is a power-hungry country that needs huge amounts of electricity to develop. It is highly dependent on natural gas reserves that are dwindling, he said. “We have no other option but to go for coal — the long-term solution is coal-based power plants”.

Background

GCM Resources, formerly Asia Energy Corporation, is a British company established with the sole purpose of building a coal mine and power plant in Phulbari. The company, as Asia Energy, had an earlier proposal for a mine and power plant in the 2000's (see Phulbari Coal Project (Asia Energy)). That proposal was met with considerable resistance, with three people having been killed and more than 200 injured by police in a public protest against the proposal in August 2006.

In September 2018 GCM Resources announced that China's Sinohydro Corporation (of Chinese engineering and construction firm PowerChina) will undertake a pre-feasibility study for a 4,000 MW Phulbari mine-mouth power plant. GCM has stated that this is a separate proposal from the earlier 2,000-MW proposal with China Energy Engineering Corporation's China Gezhouba, the Phulbari Coal Project (China Gezhouba).[1] A report released in November 2018 concluded that the proposed Phulbari coal mine could power 6,000 MW of coal plants.[2]

In January 2019 GCM Resources signed a joint venture agreement and EPC contract with PowerChina for the proposed development of two 1,000-MW mine-mouth coal-fired power units with an approximate investment of US$4 billion.[3][4] In March 2019, GCM signed a second Joint Venture Agreement with PowerChina in relation to the second phase (2 x 1,000MW units).[5]

According to the GCM Resources 2019 Annual Report, ""PowerChina has seen feasibility studies and proposals for the 4,000MW Phases I and II completed."" Additionally: ""The arrangements with PowerChina also carry an obligation to conduct any required power plant feasibility studies, facilitate the inclusion of the Project in the ‘One Belt, One Road Initiative’ of the People’s Republic of China, and assist with financing the power plants.""[6]

In July 2019, GCM Resources announced it had entered into a bilateral agreement with China Nonferrous Metal Industry and Power Construction Corporation of China (PowerChina) to jointly manage the Phulbari Coal Mine project.[7]

In February 2020, GCM Resources said it has secured a US$1.5 million increase to its existing loan facility of US$3 million with Polo Resources Ltd, raising the total loan amount to US$4.5 million. GCM plans to use the loan on its partnerships with PowerChina, Power Construction Corp of China, and China Nonferrous Metal Industry's Foreign Engineering and Construction Co for the development of the Phulbari coal & power project.[8]

Protests

In December 2018, protesters with Phulbari Solidarity Group, Extinction Rebellion, and Reclaim the Power blocked the entrance to GCM Resources' shareholder meeting in London, in a protest against the proposed project.[9]

Background on Matarbari

It was reported in March 2014 that ""Coal Power Generation Company Bangladesh (CPGCB) will get $4.53 billion loan according to the agreement with Japanese donor agency Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for the construction of a 1200MW coal-fired plant at Matarbari on Maheshkhali Island in Cox's Bazar.""[4][6]

In February 2014, the Daily Star described the approximately $4 billion price-tag of the Matarbari project as ""staggering."" The paper reported that a feasibility study had been conducted for the project by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and Tokyo Electric Power (TEPC). According to the study, the cost was far higher than the 1320 MW Rampal power station, which would cost at least $1.5 billion. The reason for the high price of the Matarbari project is the additional components: river dredging, transmission, land acquisition (Tk350 crore), and a port on Sonadia Island capable of receiving and unloading large ships. Power would cost nearly Tk 7 per kilowatt hour when the plant goes into operation in 2023.[7]

According the Daily Star's report on the Jica/TEPCO feasibility study, the project would begin construction in 2017. The site has six threatened species, including one bird and five reptiles. The plant would use ultra-supercritical technology. Its cooling water would be discharged into the sea ""at an ambient temperature."" It would have ""elaborate air and water pollution control arrangements."" The study promised that the plant would provide ""full electrification of the local community.""[7]

The Daily Star reported the implementation process as follows:[7]

As per the project's implementation schedule, the government needs to sign a loan agreement by late March and then appoint a consultant. But due to the volatile political situation since late last year, progress to this end has been stalled. Officials at this point are not sure about when the loan agreement could be signed and with whom.

The schedule also says that the basic design, bid documents preparation and floating of the tender for prequalifying power companies for this project would be done within next year and the contract would be awarded in 2016 so that a 52-month construction can begin in 2017.

However, in August 2014 the Planning Minister Mustafa Kamal announced that the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) had approved the project and that the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) funding for the project was US$3.8 billion as a ""soft loan."" The Minister stated that he hoped that the first 600MW unit of the plant would be commissioned in 2018.[8]

In January 2015 the project was approved as part of the government's priority-based ""Fast-Track Projects"".[9]

According to a February 2016 report, construction will begin in late 2016, with Sumitomo Corporation and Marubeni Corporation shortlisted to build the plant. The amount of the loan is US$3.7 billion, with an interest rate of 0.1 percent over 30 years after an initial 10-year grace period. The thermal efficiency of the plant is estimated at 41.3 percent.[10]

In November 2016 it was reported bidding between Marubeni Corporation and Sumitomo Corporation on constructing the plant would be extended to 2017.[11]

In January 2017 Marubeni and a consortium of Toshiba-Sumitomo submitted technical and financial bids for the US$4.5 billion coal project.[12] In May 2017 it was reported that the bids had been evaluated and the contract was expected to be awarded by June 2017 and physical works by July 2017.[13][14]

In June 2017 it was reported that Marubeni had been rejected as its financial offer was allegedly not satisfactory. The technical evaluation committee (TEC) of the project has recommended Sumitomo Corporation as the eligible bidder. A pre-contract negotiation with Sumitomo is supposed to be finalised within two months.[15]

In July 2017 it was reported construction by Sumitomo Corporation would begin in August 2017, with operation planned for 2024. Sumitomo will also build the Matarbari Port.[16]

In September 2017 it was reported that a Japanese consortium comprising Sumitomo Corporation, Toshiba Corporation, and IHI Corporation signed an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract for the 1,200 MW coal-fired power plant. It was reported as under construction and is expected to be completed in July, 2024.[17][18] In March 2018 it was reported that ""two percent of the main work of this plant has been done"",[19] although it is preparatory land development work. The main construction work of the power plant is planned to start in 2020.[20]

In June 2018 the Japanese government approved a loan of US$608 million for the project, as part of its 39th Official Development Assistance (ODA) loan package.[21]

On June 30, 2019, Japan agreed to lend Bangladesh US$1.31 billion under an development assistance (ODA) loan package for the construction of the Matarbari coal plant.[22] A further US$1.33 billion contribution from JICA is planned, and Nippon Export and Investment Insurance is providing export credit insurance coverage for the project. Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation is the project's Financial advisor.[23]

To develop the project, the ground needs to be raised 10 meters above mean sea level. In April 2019, it was reported that land development and channel excavation was 70% completed.[24]

Planet satellite photos from February 2018 to September 2019 show significant dredging and land clearing, and from October 2019 to May 2020 show preliminary construction work has begun.

Project impacts

According to local news reports, the construction of Matarbari Phase 1 blocked watergates and natural drainage systems designed to drain flooding caused by monsoons and cyclone-induced storms, “resulting in water logging after heavy rainfall, causing immense suffering for locals”.[23] In 2018, 22 out of 31 villages were waterlogged and inundated, and local communities reported “five incidents of death by drowning, of which all were children.”[25] Seven school children were also severely injured by a boat sinking incident during their commute from school.[23]

The land acquisition process for Matarbari Phase 1, which commenced in 2013, has resulted in the loss of people’s homes and livelihoods.[26] The process has caused upset because the community was not properly consulted and, to date, not adequately compensated. Displaced families have not been relocated to new housing facilities promised by the project proponents, forcing some to migrate and resettle elsewhere.[27] The communities have also lost traditional livelihoods in salt cultivation and shrimp farming, leaving 20,000 people without the means to make a living.[28]

Potential air pollution impacts are also expected to be severe and, given the extensive Japanese interest in the project, would not be acceptable in Japan. According to a research report by Greenpeace Southeast Asia and Greenpeace Japan, Matarbari Phase 1 would not meet the pollution standards applied to new plants constructed in Japan. The report finds pollution from Matarbari Phase 1 alone would cause up to 14,000 premature deaths during its operational years.[29]

Worker issues

COVID-19 Workers' Strike

The 3,000 labourers at the Matarbari construction site have been forced to work during the COVID-19 pandemic despite strict government orders to stop. In April 2020, the workers went on strike demanding their right to safe health. When probed by reporters, a CPGCBL spokesperson denied any grievances by workers and stated that work will continue.[23]

Two workers die during construction

On July 13, 2020, it was reported that two workers died during construction of the Matarbari plant when an electric pillar fell. The pillar fell on one worker, killing him instantly. Another worker was on the pillar when it fell and died later in the hospital.[30]

Phase II

In June 2019 it was reported that to reduce the production cost of Matarbari, another power plant will have to be constructed. According to EnergyBangla, ""the per unit power production cost with imported coal will be around Tk. 6.5. But at Matarbari, the cost will be Tk 13.5. If another power plant is constructed then it will be able to use the same infrastructure. As a result, the production cost will fall.""[31]

Phase II is listed in the Bangladesh Master Plan (updated in November 2018), with a proposed commissioning of 2028.[32]

To establish phase II, the government has asked loan assistance from the Japan International Co-operation Agency (JICA). Phase II will be two additional units. It is planned that Sumitomo Corporation, Toshiba and IHI Corporation of Japan will build the plant. Reportedly 1608 acres of land have been acquired.[31]

On June 19, 2020, Japan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) confirmed that it had decided to proceed with a preparatory survey by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for the proposed Phase 2. In a joint statement, 350.org and other NGOs called for the Japanese government to stop the survey, saying new solar was already cheaper than new coal power in Bangladesh; that the project was not in line with Japan's climate commitments; and that phase I of Matarbari was already resulting in severe disruptions to people's livelihoods.[33]

Maheshkhali power complex

Matarbari power station is part of a large multi-plant complex being organized by the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB). In August 2013 the BPDB announced that it intended to develop a multi-plant power complex at Cox's Bazaar, including both coal-fired plants and combined cycle gas-fired plants. The announcement stated that the BPDB ""intends to build 6000 MW Ultra Super Critical Coal Based Thermal Power Plant and 3000 MW LNG Based Combined Cycle Power Plant in different phases at Maheshkhali Upazila in Cox’s Bazar District."" The announcement stated that the fuel for the projects would be imported coal and liquified natural gas. Five thousand acres were in the process of aqcquisition, situated within Amabassaya, Honanok and Panir Chhara mouza of Hoanok Union and Gharibhanga mouza of Kutubjhom union under Maheshkhali upazila, Cox’s Bazar. Ultra-supercritical technology would be employed by the coal plants, which would be sized at 600 to 1000 MW per unit.[34]

Payra Power Plant Development

Bangladesh’s NWPGCL and China’s CMC signed the memorandum of understanding (MoU) for the Payra coal-fired power plant in March 2014.

The special-purpose consortium company BCPCL was created in June 2014 to implement the project.

BCPCL submitted the environmental impact assessment (EIA) for the project in September 2015 and the Bangladesh Government issued environment clearance to the project in 2016.

Payra is the first power plant to come online, among a series of new thermal power projects being developed across the country as part of Bangladesh’s plan to increase its electricity generation capacity from 10,445MW in 2014 to 24,000MW by 2021.

Payra power plant make-up

Built on a 1,000-acre site, Payra power plant will comprise two ultra-supercritical pulverised coal-fired single reheat boilers of 1,965t/h capacity, two single-axle eight-stage 660MW steam turbines, two water-hydrogen cooled generators, 32 forced draft cooling towers of 4,800m³/h capacity and a 275m-high flue stack to be shared with both the generating units.

Other facilities of the plant include a 400kV switchyard, three coal storage yards, a fly ash storage area, and water treatment plants.

Further, the plant is being equipped with electrostatic precipitators, flue gas desulfurisation, and low NOx combustion technology for emissions control.

Payra power plant uses water from the nearby Andhamanik River for cooling, coal handling, ash handling, and steam generation.

Coal supply for Payra power plant

The coal requirement for the plant is estimated to be 4.12 million tonnes per year (Mt/y), which will be imported from Indonesia, China, and Australia.

The coal from Indonesia will be loaded at Kalimantan Port on a 70,000DWT cargo vessel and unloaded at the newly built Payra port.

The project involves three 8,000DWT coal unloading berths and one 2,000DWT heavy cargo berth. Coal is transferred to the 14m-wide 1,750t/h coal conveyor belt, with the help of 16t gantry type grab ship unloaders.

The Payra power plant site received the first coal shipment in September 2019.

Power transmission

Electricity generated by the power plant is fed to the national grid via double-circuit 400kV transmission lines connected with the 400kV Patuakhali grid substation of Power Grid Company of Bangladesh (PGCB).

Financing for Payra power project

The £1.5bn ($2bn) Payra power project is financed through 30% equity investment provided by BCPCL partners and 70% debt provided through loan from Chinese banks led by Chinese Export-Import (Exim) bank.

Contractors involved

BCPCL awarded the £1.1bn ($1.56bn) EPC contract for the power plant to a Chinese consortium comprising China Energy Engineering Group Northeast No. 1 Electric Power Construction (NEPC) and China National Energy Engineering and Construction (CECC), in March 2016.

Dongfang Boiler Group was subcontracted to supply the boilers and Shanghai Electric Group was subcontracted to provide the steam turbine generators for the coal-fired power plant.

Minconsult, an engineering consultancy based in Malaysia, along with Shenzhen Engineering and Power Energy Management & Engineering (PEMEC), was awarded the £10.6m ($14.9m) owner’s engineering (OE) services contract for the project, in June 2016.

National Development Engineers (NDE), a construction company based in Bangladesh, was engaged for the land development work for the project. The company is also responsible for civil construction works including the access road, jetty road and helipad construction.

Active	"Country’s first ever natural gas based power plant in Chittagong started producing electricity by imported liquefied natural gas (LNG), said State Minister for Power, Energy and Mineral Resources Nasrul Hamid Sunday.

The Shikalbaha 225MW power plant began to produce electricity using imported LNG from August 20, 2018. Earlier, the plant was run by locally produced piped natural gas, said officials.

Despite import of LNG, a good number of gas-fired power plants having generation capacity of about 400MW of electricity remain inoperative mainly due to stringent supply situation of the natural gas. The state minister, however, said that the gas crisis will be resolved shortly. He said that consumers will get affordable power despite costly import of LNG. He also said the government has also taken steps to import one lakh metric tonnes of coal immediately to make a buffer stoke. It will help feed coal-fired power plant at Barapukuria.

“We have invited proposals from foreign suppliers for import of coal,” he said. The government has recently decided to import about one lakh metric tonnes of coal immediately on an emergency basis to run the power plant at Dinajpur that supplies electricity in the country's northern region.

The power plant suspended its production on July 22 for an indefinite period due to lack of fuel supply, a fallout of around 1.45 lakh tonnes of coal “going missing” from the coal mine yard.

According to power division, the greater Rangpur and Rajshahi divisions have been facing around 150MW-200MW of load-shedding of electricity due to shut down of Barapukuria coal-fired power plant.

The minister also admitted load-shedding of electricity at Rangpur due to shut down Barapukuria power plant, having capacity to generate 525MW of electricity. Nasrul Hamid said that electricity supply situation improved substantially during the Eid as compared to the previous days."	https://www.daily-sun.com/printversion/details/331742/2018/08/27/Shikalbaha-power-plant-run-by-imported-LNG

Active	"The Meghnaghat 450MW combined-cycle gas-fired power plant is located on a 25.09ha site 22km south of Dhaka on the northern bank of the Meghna River.

The $289.6m plant was built by US-based AES (Allied Energy Systems) over a 22-year power purchase agreement with Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB).

The engineering, procurement and construction contract for the facility was awarded to Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI).

Operations at the plant began in November 2002. In 2003, AES sold the plant to the UK company CDC Globeleq, which sold the plant to Malaysia-based Pendekar Group in 2007.

The plant is 76% held by Pendekar Energy and 24% by Pendekar Energy Ventures (PEVL).

The Bangladeshi Government had been purchasing electricity from the Meghnaghat power plant at a price below two cents per unit, which is considered to be the lowest ever electricity price in the world.

Pendekar Energy Group sought approval from the Power Ministry for enhancing the capacity of the Meghnaghat power plant by 170MW.

Named Meghnaghat I, the second phase, 335MW dual-fuel combined cycle unit became operational in 2014.

Additional base-load capacity of Meghnaghat power facility

Meghnaghat supplies domestic, agricultural and industrial users. The project offers extra base-load capacity to help solve Bangladesh’s present and forecasted power shortages. As of mid-2009, the generating capacity of the 450MW plant accounted for 9% of the total power generated in the country.

The plant load factor was 88.21% in 2007. By the end of that year, the Meghnaghat power plant supplied around 14,875GWh of electricity to BPDB.

Hydraulic model study for the Meghnaghat power plant

The project lies downstream of the Meghna Bridge at Meghna Ferryghat, an area that is influenced by significant tidal action during the dry season. The plant draws cool water from the river and discharges the hot water back into the freshwater source.

“The project lies in an area that is influenced by significant tidal action during the dry season.”

A hydraulic model study for the plant by DHI (Danish Hydraulic Institute)/ SWMC (Surface Water Modelling Centre) included thermal plume and morphological modelling.

The hydraulic model study avoided the inappropriate location of intake and outlet of water, which would endanger aquatic life while causing a tremendous loss of efficiency. It examined river hydraulics, advection-dispersion of heated water and sediment transport and scouring along the proposed location of the plant using advanced mathematical tools.

Construction of the Meghnaghat CCGT plant

Meghnaghat was constructed by Hyundai Engineering and Construction using combined-cycle gas turbines fed by natural gas.

The plant uses two V94.2 gas turbines with air-cooled generators from Ansaldo Energia. The V94.2 is a single shaft, cold-end drive dual combustor with 16 burners and a heavy-duty gas turbine. It includes a 16-stage axial compressor and a four-stage axial turbine with a common rotor.

The generator has a conventional design for use with gas turbines. The air-cooled, two-pole machine has a cylindrical rotor and is ventilated in closed circuit configuration using air-to-water heat exchangers located in the lower part of the stator frame. Dry low-NOx combustors achieve the guaranteed NOx emission level. Steam or water injection is not required.

Heat recovery steam generators at the power plant in Meghnaghat

The Hyundai Heat Recovery Steam Generators (HRSGs) produce superheated HP steam, superheated reheat steam and superheated LP steam. They are designed for 100% full-load continuous operating conditions. The HRSGs use supplementary firing to achieve the required 450MW net output at the high voltage side of the outgoing terminals of the 230kV transformer. The HRSGs, pumps and auxiliaries are designed for outdoor installation.

The plant uses a FUJI triple-pressure (HP, IP and LP), reheat, condensing, down exhaust type steam turbine with an air-cooled generator. The steam turbine has no steam extraction. The two-pole generator is totally enclosed and water-to-air-cooled.

The steam turbine is installed indoors for environmental protection and acoustic attenuation. The steam turbine building has an overhead travelling crane for heavy-load maintenance lifting. The building has suitable indoor laydown areas for plant maintenance.

The gas turbine maintenance contract was awarded to Ansaldo, an Italian company. A long-term parts management contract was awarded to Siemens Germany in 2006.

Financing of Meghnaghat CCGT

450MW Meghnaghat power plant was financed through $220m of debt and $75m of equity.

The debt facilities were provided by the Asian Development Bank and other lenders. An $80m loan, the largest from any Bangladeshi financial institution, was extended by Infrastructure Development Company.

Meghnaghat phase II

A new CCGT power plant known as Meghnaghat plant phase II or Summit Meghnaghat Power Plant is under construction at Meghnaghat. It will be a 583MW power project installed with GE’s high efficiency and an air-cooled gas turbine 9HA.02 capable of producing 590MW using gas/regasified LNG fuel or 541MW using high-speed diesel.

The project is being built by Summit Meghnaghat II Power Company, a subsidiary of Summit Group and BPDB.

SMPCL signed agreements to develop the Meghnaghat II project for an investment of approximately $390m in March 2019. The project is expected to be operational by March 2022."	https://www.power-technology.com/projects/meghnaghat/

Active	"Shikalbaha 60 MW Power plant

Steam turbine power plant is a generating station which converts heat energy of coal combustion into electrical energy. Shikalbaha 60MW power plant is one of the steam turbine power plant. In this type of generating system, steam is produced in the boiler by utilizing the heat of coal combustion and this steam is then expanded in the steam turbine. Finally, the steam turbine drives the generators and the generator converts the mechanical energy of the turbine into electrical energy.

In Shikalbaha 60MW power station, there are different types of pump have used such as circulating water pump, feed water pump and lube oil pump, demy water pump etc.

Circulating water pump

The circulating water pump supply large amount of river water in condenser is to minimize the steam temperature. It is mainly used in cooling system because it circulates water within a closed circuit. The circulating water extracts heat from demi water and drop into the river. There are two pump houses are used in this power station. One is open system and another is closed system. Open system uses when water is available in Karnafully River. Closed system uses when the water is not available i.e. during dry season. In Shikalbaha 60MW power plant two 4MW pumps used; one is used for closed system and another is used for open system.

Feed water pump

It is a boiler feed water pump that is used to supply demi-water in the boiler tank from water treatment plant to produce continuous steam in the boiler. The water freshly supplied from treatment plant or returning condensate produced as a result of the condensation of the steam produced by the boiler. Feed water pumps are normally high pressure units (»11 bars) that take suction from a condensate return system.

Lube oil pump

In Shikalbaha 60MW power plant, lube oil pump is used. The using purpose of this pump is pumping lube oil for lubrication of turbine and generator bearing. Lube oil supplies to the bearing for cooling also. The pump supplies more lube oil in the system with the falling of the pressure. The lube oil pump needs to be able to operate over a wide range of temperature and liquid viscous conditions.

Water treatment plant

The raw water is collected from the river. This water cannot be used to produce steam. The raw water carries some small portion of mineral which can break or harm the turbine blades. Some process is applied to demineralize the raw water which is fed to the boiler. All the process has finished in the water treatment plant. Figure-3.2 shows a block diagram that describes the whole water treatment system.

Demi water pump

In Shikalbaha 60MW power plant the demineralized water flows into the condenser through the demi water pump. This pump controls the water flowing in the condenser.

Boiler

Boiler is a device that is used to produce steam by applying heat energy from the water. There are two types of boilers. One is fire tube boiler and another is water tube boiler. Water tube boiler is used in this power plant. The purpose of the boiler is to produce necessary and quality steam continuously. It is used to run the turbine.

Shikalbaha 60MW power plant Boiler

Furnace

Furnace is the chamber inside the boiler. In this chamber natural gas and air is burned for producing flue gas by keeping gas and air ratio of 1:10. In Shikalbaha steam power station, the temperature inside the furnace chamber is almost 1800°-2000° C. The treated water enters into the furnace through tubes and the flue gas passes around the tubes. Flue gas releases heat and water convert into saturated steam. Temperature of this saturated steam is about 350° C and pressure is about 158kgf/cm2. The forced draught fan forcefully supplies air to the furnace and the saturated steam from the furnace goes to the boiler drum.

Burner

Burner is a fire making component in steam power plant. Burner needs ignition gas to initiate the operation of burner. The ignition gas comes to the burner through ignition pipes. In Shikalbaha steam power station, each furnace has 9 burners and each burner produces 7 MW of power.

Boiler drum

The water is reserved in the boiler drum. This water comes to the boiler drum from economizer. Water pressure in the boiler drum maintains a level by level transmitter. This system is controlled by an automatic safety valve. From the boiler drum the saturated steam is supplied to the super heater.

Economizer

The feed water is fed to the economizer before supplying to the boiler. Economizer is essentially a feed water heater and drives heat from the flue gases. It extracts some heat of flue gases which increases the feed water temperature. It helps to increase the boiler efficiency, reduce fuel costs and also reduce stresses in the boiler. It is basically consist of a large number of closely spaced parallel steel tubes which is connected by headers of drums. The temperature of feed water rises because a part of the heat of flue gases is transferred to feed water.

Super heater

After vaporization steam boilers can produce low quality steam that requires additional superheating of the steam. So the steam is superheated by the heat of flue gases in super heater. In Shikalbaha steam turbine power station, the superheated temperature of the steam is 540°C and the pressure 130 kgf/cm2 [5].

Condenser

A condenser condenses the exhaust steam of the turbine. There are two major functions of the condenser. First, it helps to convert the heat energy of steam into mechanical energy in turbine. Second, the condensed steam of the condenser can be used as feed water into the boiler. It consists of a bank of horizontal tubes enclosed in a cast iron shell.

ID fan & FD fan

Induced Draught Fan (ID fan) is located between the radiant air heater and chimney. ID fan delivered the hot flue gases to chimney from the radiant air heater. Forced Draught Fan (FD fan) is used basically for providing the requirement quantity of hot air to the furnace for combustion of fuel. ID fan creates negative pressure in the furnace to remove the flue gases from furnace and push the hot flue gas to the chimney. The temperature of the negative forced flue gas is 128°C which is removed by the chimney. Furthermore, FD fan produced positive pressure inside the furnace. The temperature of the hot air is 50°C and pressure is 510 kgf/cm2

Steam Turbine

Steam turbine is a mechanical device that converts thermal energy into mechanical energy. The thermal energy extracted from pressurized steam. Steam turbine is attached to a generator that acts as a prime mover. The turbine basically consists of rotary blades and stator blades wheels. Stator blades are fixed and rotors blades are attached to the rotor of the steam turbine. The rotor gets rotated by exerting a force on the blades with the steam. Shikalbaha 60MW power plant is one of the steam turbine power plant in Bangladesh.

High pressure turbine

Firstly, the high pressure steam from the super heater enters to the high pressure turbine. Blades of the high pressure turbine are smaller than other blades of the turbine. In this part of the turbine, the incoming steam has very high energy having low volume. The blades are fixed to a shaft and as the steam hits the blades, it causes the shaft to rotate. In shikalbaha 60MW power plant the high pressure turbine temperature is 5300C and the pressure is 28 kg-cm-2

Intermediate pressure turbine

The steam from the re-heater enters to the intermediate pressure turbine. The turbine blades of the intermediate pressure turbine are bigger than that of high pressure turbine. This is because the steam has expanded and lost energy. After hitting the blades, steam goes straight to the next section of turbine set. In the intermediate pressure turbine the temperature is 5300C and the pressure is 25 kg-cm-2

Low pressure turbine

The steam from intermediate pressure turbine enters into the low pressure turbine. The steam gets expanded in this section. The blades of the low pressure turbine are larger than the other two sections and the energy of steam is lesser than other two sections of the turbine. In the low pressure turbine, the temperature is about 5300C and the pressure is about 1.34 kg-cm-2

Generator

Generator is an electrical device that converts mechanical energy to electrical energy. In Shikalbaha 60MW power plant, AC Generators are used which produces alternating current. Main two parts of that generator are rotor and stator. An external force rotates the rotor. Rotating part of the steam turbine is connected with the generator’s rotor. So, when the rotor of steam turbine starts moving, the rotor of the generator also starts moving. As a result, we get electricity. The generating voltage of this power plant is 15.75 KV. The running capacity of the plant is 40-42 MW. The rotation speed of the rotor of this power station is 3000 RPM.

DC exciter

For exciting, the alternator field needs DC current. DC current comes from another DC source. A DC generator is connected to the alternator. That DC generator is called exciter. Alternator and exciter are connected in the same shaft.

Step up transformer (power transformer)

Step up transformer is used to step up the voltage of generator. The step up transformer increases the generating voltage from 15.75 KV to 132 KV. Power Grid Company of Bangladesh (PGCB) controls this 132 KV transmission line."	https://powerplantinbd.com/shikalbaha-60mw-power-plant/

Bangladesh, already at the mercy of climate change’s rising sea levels and increasingly severe tropical cyclones, has turned to Japan for help building its energy infrastructure. But despite Bangladesh’s commitment to using 100 percent renewable energy, the Japanese government and Sumitomo Corporation are proceeding with the construction of a new coal power plant in Matarbari, next to Bangladesh’s major coastal tourist area. Unbelievably, Japan’s government is considering whether to finance yet another coal plant in Matarbari.

The first Matarbari coal plant is a disaster – it is expensive, a bad investment, and an embarrassment to Sumitomo and Japan. Here are ten reasons why a second plant should never see the light of day.

The Matarbari coal project is:

A mismanaged money pit

The project was already 30% over budget and at least a year behind schedule before the global pandemic hit.[1] In a desperate bid to defray the project’s high costs, Japan is considering doubling-down on a bad investment and building an additional coal plant in Matarbari.[2] Japan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs is expected to decide whether to proceed with an additional plant this summer.

Destroying the value of the “Made in Japan” label

For decades, “Made in Japan” has long meant precision craftsmanship at reasonable prices, but that is not what Sumitomo Corporation is planning for Bangladesh. The Matarbari coal plant units 1 & 2 will use unnecessarily polluting technology that would never be allowed in Japan, polluting up to 21 times the amount of SO 2 and 10 times the amount of deadly particles than an average new coal plant in Japan.[3] Why is Japan dumping dirty technologies in developing countries?

Bad for health

Bangladesh already suffers from poor air quality and the excessive pollution from the under-construction Matarbari coal plant would put nearby communities significantly over WHO health guidelines for concentrations of air pollution. Air pollution contributes to respiratory diseases and even premature death.[4] The construction of additional coal plants would further pollute the air and water.

A dirty debt trap

The Matarbari coal plant units 1 & 2 resulted from a non-competitive bidding process, a sweetheart deal that includes up-front financing from the Japanese government and construction carried out by Sumitomo Corporation, a Japanese company.[5] Japan’s assistance comes at a price — local media reported the cost of electricity from this plant is anticipated to be excessively high due to the construction delays, cost overruns and related coal infrastructure needed. If Japan doubles down on this project with a second phase to try to defray costs, it would lock Bangladeshis into a high debt, high carbon and high pollution future.

More expensive than renewable energy alternatives

Japan could use its technological knowhow to help Bangladesh transition to a clean, renewable energy future. Energy analysts found that solar power would not only be cleaner, but also a far cheaper approach than coal for Bangladesh, with the levelized electricity cost of solar PV estimated at $91/MWh (USD) compared to an average coal cost of $110/MWh,[6] and the Matarbari Units 1 & 2 reported to produce electricity at a staggering $135/MWh (or 13.5 cents/KWh).[7] Bangladeshi ratepayers should not be saddled with high energy costs when their country has an abundance of solar potential.

A source of new climate changing emissions in a nation vulnerable to climate impacts

Matarbari Units 1 & 2 are under construction, with the Japanese government considering financing two more coal units. This is ironic, as Bangladesh is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, especially sea level rise and flooding, and has joined countries in similar circumstances as part of the Climate Vulnerable Forum.

Bad for workers

Bangladeshi news sources have reported that construction workers for Matarbari Units 1 & 2 went on strike after being forced to work during a national lockdown for COVID-19.[8] Sumitomo Corporation should ensure that its partners and contractors respect workers’ rights and health, especially during a global pandemic. This double-standard is especially hypocritical as Sumitomo Corporation’s 4000 Japanese employees were directed to work from home starting on March 1,[9] well before a state of emergency was declared for the Tokyo region on April 7, 2020. Sadly, this behavior is unsurprising, as Sumitomo has had weaker protections for human rights than its Japanese trading company peers, [10] and only established a basic human rights policy this May.[11]

Against Japan’s climate commitments

Japan’s participation in the Paris Agreement led the Cabinet to adopt a policy in 2019 to develop infrastructure which helps contribute to global reductions of CO 2 It is inconsistent for the Japanese government and Japanese companies like Sumitomo continue to build coal plants abroad. Furthermore, as Bangladesh has affordable clean energy alternatives, the proposed Matarbari coal plant does not meet the test laid out in Japan’s Fifth Strategic Energy Plan (2018) that new coal would be considered: “only for countries that have no choice but to select coal as a key source of energy from the viewpoints of energy security and economic efficiency.”[12]

Bad for local residents

Densely populated, an estimated 90,000 people lived on Matarbari and relied upon shrimp farming and salt cultivation for their livelihoods. That changed in 2013 when communities were forced into a land acquisition process for 5,000 acres to make way for the new coal plants and related coal infrastructure. A survey of residents found many were unable to take part in compensation programs, not provided with alternative employment, and left without their place of work or homes.[13] Advocates note that these delays in compensation, alternate housing, and employment do not meet the Japan International Cooperation Agency’s Guidelines for Environmental and Social Considerations.[14]

Bad for the tourist economy

Matarbari Island, the site of the project, lies near Bangladesh’s Cox’s Bazar, an area beloved by tourists for its natural beauty, long sandy shorelines, wildlife sanctuaries, marine reserve, and national parks.[15] Air pollution and water pollution from these new coal plants threaten the long-term viability of Cox’s Bazar as a tourist destination and damage the potential for future economic development.

The world is watching to see what Japan will do. Will Bangladeshis be locked into a dirty debt trap with high electricity prices, high air pollution and high global warming pollution? A coalition of organizations in Japan, Bangladesh and across the world are calling upon on the Japanese government to reject financing for a second coal plant at Matarbari.[16] For the sake of the company’s reputation, Sumitomo Corporation should withdraw from its role managing and building the Matarbari coal plants.

The country's largest-ever Payra 1320-Megawatt Thermal Power Plant has begun electricity production on an experimental basis.

Helal Shah Abdul Mawla, project director of the power plant, said the plant was synchronised with the national grid at 11am on Monday.

""The plant is now supplying 100MW power to the national grid. During the testing period, the plant's power generation will increase gradually. We have a target to produce maximum 600MW power by January 27,"" he added.

After the trial production, necessary preparations will be taken to go into the commercial production, Helal Shah further said.

According to sources, the Payra thermal power plant will require 6,000 tonnes of coal per day to keep the first unit running in full force. The country has been importing the fuel from Indonesia.

Construction of the coal-fired power plant started on March 30, 2016 at Kalapara in Patuakhali. Bangladesh-China Power Company Limited, a joint venture between Bangladesh's Northwestern Power Generation Company and China's state-owned CMC, has been implementing the project.

The power station was earlier scheduled for production in December 2018. But it lagged behind in following the schedule as the construction of seaports and power transmission lines for importing fuel was delayed.

As a result, the plant was rescheduled for August 27, 2019 to go into operation. But it finally came into production four more months later."	https://tbsnews.net/bangladesh/energy/payra-thermal-power-plant-begins-trial-production-36095

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is expected to inaugurate the formal operation of the power plant.

The implementing agency of the plant, Electricity Generation Company of Bangladesh (EGCB’s) Managing Director, Mostafa Kamal confirmed the development at a press conference at the Bidyut Bhaban in the city yesterday.

Prime Minister’s Energy Advisor Tawfiq-E-Elahi Chowdhury and State Minister for Power Muhammad Enamul Huq were also present at the press conference.

“However, the commercial production at the plant will probably start on September 20,” said Mostafa Kamal.

The Haripur plant was supposed to go into production in July but failed to do so, he admitted.

The prime minister is also expected to lay the foundation stone of another 335MW gas-fired Siddhirganj Combined-Cycle Power Plant there.

Accepting the fact that uninterrupted gas supply to the plant will be a challenge, Tawfiq-E-Elahi Chowdhury said: “Gas crisis is a big challenge for us but we have to go ahead, overcoming this.”

He said another 500MW electricity would be imported from India by October, but declined making any comment on the progress of coal-based power plants.

Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) sources said the government may shut down the inefficient 96MW Haripur Power Plant under PDB to supply gas to the 412MW Haripur Combine Cycle Power Plant.

In addition, a PDB official seeking anonymity said, other gas-based power plants might as well face shortages in supply due to the new plant. If that happens, the 412MW plant will have little effect on the total power generation of the country.

After Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had laid the foundation stone of the plant on March 20, 2011, the state-run EGCB has constructed the plant with the assistance of Marubeni Corporation of Japan as the Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contractor.

The plant will require 64mm cfd gas to operate in full capacity while production cost of per unit of electricity will be Tk1.7154.

Land Lease Agreement was signed between EGCB and Power Development Board on 29 August, 2011 for 8.573 acres of land at Haripur area on rental basis for a period of 25 years.

The government implemented the power project at a cost of $376m with financial support from Japan International Cooperation Agency (Jica).

Though some 56 plants have added over 4282MW of electricity to the national grid during the last four and half years, dependence on rental and quick-rental power plants ranging from 20-150MW has put huge burden on the national coffers.

The government has plans to build 11 gas-based plants under both public and private sectors, producing 3500MW of electricity.

Sources at the PDB said, electricity generation in the country yesterday was about 6000MW against a projected demand for 7000MW."	https://www.dhakatribune.com/uncategorized/2013/08/22/412mw-haripur-power-plant-goes-into-operation-tomorrow

DHAKA, BANGLADESH- SEPTEMBER 13, 2017-GE (NYSE: GE) today announced that it has been selected by the Shapoorji Pallonji Group (SP Group) to supply the power generation equipment for the upcoming 220 megawatt (MW) combined cycle power plant in the Bhola district of Bangladesh. This will be GE’s second power plant in Bhola of the same capacity with the first being commissioned in 2015. The announcement continues GE’s regional leadership in delivering innovative technologies and state-of-the-art equipment to its power generation customers in South Asia, strengthening GE’s installed base in India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.

“The Bhola power project will be an important milestone for the Shapoorji Pallonji Group in Bangladesh, contributing towards increasing the country’s power generation capacity. GE’s technological prowess and on-the-ground local market expertise proved to be a huge advantage for our teams right through the process of configuration selection, to submission of cutting edge performance parameters and detailed proposal to the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB). Early engagement with the GE technical team helped incorporate design features to meet stringent project requirements. We would be happy to continue our collaboration with GE on other power projects globally as well.” said Mitesh Soni, Business Head - Power Business, Shapoorji Pallonji Group.

The Bhola project is being developed by the SP Group as an Independent Power Producer (IPP). The SP Group has signed a 22-year Power Purchase Agreement with BPDB. The power plant will operate on duel-fuel technology using natural gas as the primary fuel and diesel as the back-up fuel and is expected to achieve commercial operations by December 2019. The project will result in supplying the equivalent power needed to provide electricity to 200,000 homes in Bangladesh.

“Countries in South Asia are accelerating towards achieving energy security which has led to greater investment in the sector. GE’s technology advantage and local presence in South Asia gives us an edge in addressing the needs of our customers in the region,” said Deepesh Nanda, CEO of GE’s Gas Power Systems in South Asia.

“Bangladesh specifically provides an enabling policy framework to accelerate power generation capacity addition and the Bhola project is a testament of the government’s desire to achieve its ‘Power of All” objective by 2020. Likewise, Sri Lanka has embarked on augmenting its power generation capacity and GE will be at the forefront of delivering cleaner, more reliable and affordable electricity for the people of Sri Lanka.” he added.

GE Power will supply the full suite of engineered equipment package (EEP) for the project, including two 6F.03 gas turbines, two heat recovery steam generators (HRSG), one steam turbine generator, condenser and associated control systems. GE will also provide technical expertise during the installation phase of the project. Once completed, Bhola power plant will be the fleet leader for GE’s heavy duty 6F.03 gas turbine with advance gas path, delivering higher levels of efficiency, flexibility and reliability typically only seen in large capacity power plants.

Today, GE offers full scope of power generation technology and services in various regions globally. Currently, GE has an installed base of more than 35 gas turbines in Bangladesh, generating more than 2.2 gigawatts (GW) of power.

Active	"The technology group Wärtsilä is this week celebrating 20 years of supporting the development of Bangladesh by providing important added capacity to the country’s electricity grid. The latest contract signed this week is an equipment delivery for a 105 MW power plant being built by Baraka Shikalbaha Power Ltd, a private sector energy provider and subsidiary of Baraka Group, to be located near the Karnaphuli river in Shikalbaha, Chittagong, in southeastern Bangladesh. The order was booked by Wärtsilä in March and the delivery of the equipment is scheduled for October of this year.

The government of Bangladesh is making a strong effort to increase the number of households with access to electricity: in 2016, only 76 percent of the country’s houses were connected to the grid, and the aim is to increase this to 98 percent by the year 2021. As the nation’s economy develops, more electrical power is urgently needed to support this growth and during the past 12 months, Wärtsilä has booked orders for ten new generating facilities in the country: like many others, this delivery is being made on a fast-track basis to ensure that the new plant can be operational within the shortest possible time frame.

“Wärtsilä has impressed us with the speed of its response to our need for generating equipment for this new plant. We appreciate this excellent cooperation from a company with whom we have done business earlier, and whose reputation for reliability and high quality is well known,” said Mr. Gulam Rabbani Chowdhury, Managing Director, Baraka Shikalbaha Power Ltd.

“I think our track record in Bangladesh speaks for itself: repeat orders are the greatest endorsement of customer satisfaction, and our aim is always to be a trusted partner in meeting the needs of the project, however demanding,” noted Mr Jillur Rahim, Managing Director, Wärtsilä Bangladesh.

The contract scope includes six Wärtsilä 50 engines running on heavy fuel oil (HFO). The low heat rate of this engine was cited as another key consideration in the award of this order. Wärtsilä has earlier received an order from Baraka Power for six Wärtsilä 50 engines for another of its power plant projects.

Today, Wärtsilä provides about 25 percent of the total grid capacity in the country and when fully operational in spring 2019, the new plant will bring Wärtsilä’s total power supply to Bangladesh to more than 4200 MW.

Samsung C&T's construction unit (CEO Lee Young-ho) has won an order for a combined thermal power plant in Meghnaghat, Bangladesh, ordered by Reliance Bangladesh LNG & Power Limited.

Samsung C&T received a Letter of Award for the project on Sept. 30. Total construction cost is 630 million U.S. dollars, which is about 750 billion won. Samsung C&T will carry out the project on its own for 34 months. Construction is scheduled to begin in October 2019 and be completed in July 2022.



It is a construction project to build a 718-MW combined thermal power plant, including two gas turbines, one steam turbine, and a substation in Narayanganj, about 25 kilometers southeast of the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka.

The Meghnaghat combined thermal power plant is located in the Meghnaghat Industrial Complex. After its completion, it will not only expand the electricity demand for industrial complexes, but also provide residential power to the capital city of Dhaka and other neighboring areas.



According to the IMF report, Bangladesh has been growing rapidly since 2016, recording an annual economic growth rate of over 7 percent. Demand for new power plants is expected to increase in the future as electricity consumption is increasing along with economic growth.

Samsung C&T is currently carrying out the Siddhirganj combined thermal power generation project in Bangladesh, and it is strengthening its position in the Bangladesh power generation market with the order of the Meghnaghat project. Last year, it won an order to build Jawa-1 (Jawa-1) combined thermal power plant in Indonesia, expanding its scope in the Asian power generation market.

This new road tunnel connects Asia to Europe, thereby reducing the heavy traffic that has always been a feature of this route. The tunnel is 14.6 km long, 5.4 km of which run right beneath the sea bed, and has two separate levels, one for each direction of traffic. It is a highly complex feat of engineering that has taken 55 months to build and an overall investment of 1 billion 300 million dollars. The excavations began on the Asian side of the Bosphorus Strait and finished on the European side. The project has also included reorganising traffic circulation. This has meant improving the access roads to the tunnel and creating two toll plazas. These changes have cut the level of traffic in İstanbul enormously and improved the quality of the local environment by reducing both atmospheric and acoustic pollution. In addition to the immense achievement of its engineering, the project also stands out for the extremely high quality of its design.

ORHANGAZİ TUNNEL

Gebze-Orhangazi-İzmir (Including İzmit Bay Crossing and Connection Roads) Motorway Project is 426 km in length which 384 km of motorway and 42 km connection road. The longest motorway tunnel in Turkey, Orhangazi Tunnel (double tube x 3.590 m = 7.180 m) belonging to this project and located on provincial border of Bursa and Yalova has been put into service in 2016.

KONAK TUNNEL

(İZMİR-URLA-ÇEŞME MOTORWAY İKİZTEPE-KONAK-DOĞANLAR SECTION) İzmir’s heavy urban traffic problem was solved by the Konak Tunnel connected to Mustafa Kemalpaşa Boulevard over Mürselpaşa Boulevard. The two-lane double tube Konak Tunnel has a length of 2.524 m including 1.674 m tunnel and 850 m connection roads.

RİVA AND ÇAMLIK TUNNELS The Riva and Çamlık Tunnels are located on the Northern Marmara Motorway Third Bosphorus Bridge route in İstanbul. The four-lane double tube Çamlık Tunnel is the widest tunnel in Turkey and Europe. Tunnels were excavated by NATM.

CANKURTARAN TUNNEL The Cankurtaran Tunnel is a road tunnel located in Artvin Province as part of the Hopa-Borçka Highway D.010 in northeastern Turkey. Situated on the Mount Cankurtaran of Pontic Mountains between Çavuşlu village of Hopa district in the west and Çifteköprü village of Borçka district in the east, it is a 5.228 m -long twin-tube tunnel carrying two lanes of traffic in each direction. It was built to bypass the Cankurtaran Pass at 690 m elevation with many hairpin turns and to alleviate Black Sea Region’s access to Eastern Anatolia Region and consequently to Middle Eastern countries. The tunnel also eliminates the traffic burden that emerges from climatic conditions such as heavy snow fall, icing and fog. It shortens the route about 12 km. The tunnel was opened to traffic on March 1, 2018.

OVİT TUNNEL The Ovit Highway Tunnel project is located between İkizdere, Rize Province and İspir, Erzurum Province in Turkey. The mined section of the tunnel is approximately 12,6 km long. At the western end of the tunnel an approximately 1,4 km long avalanche tunnel, with the same cross section is added. The tunnel becomes one of the longest tunnel of Turkey with the length of 14 km. The Ovit Tunnel opened to traffic in 2018.

ILGAZ 15 JULY INDEPENDENCE TUNNEL Ilgaz 15 July Independence Tunnel is a highway tunnel through the Ilgaz Mountains between Kastamonu and Çankırı Provinces in northern Turkey. The tunnel has twin tubes of 5.370 m and 5.391 m in length and the entrance and exit of the tunnel is designed as “shark mouth”. It is aimed at providing faster and safer transportation on Ilgaz Mountain especially during winter months. With the tunnel, the length of the Ilgaz Mountain Road, which was 16,8 km, is shortened by 5,4 km and decreased to 11,4 km.

It will, therefore, have a chance to showcase its full potential by hosting 90 million passengers, a figure it can handle in the initial phase of development.

Already seen as the new center of aviation rising from the outskirts of Turkey's most populous city, perched firmly on the shores of the Black Sea, the airport was officially opened in a grand ceremony on Oct. 29, 2018, coinciding with the 95th anniversary of the founding of the Turkish Republic. Two days later, Turkish Airlines flight TK214 took off for the capital Ankara as the first aircraft to leave the airport.

However, its first phase became fully operational on April 7, as it took over the air traffic from the now-closed Atatürk Airport. The civil aviation adventure undertaken at Atatürk Airport, which was commissioned in 1953, said goodbye with the pride of having accomplished its mission successfully. It was one of the busiest airports in Europe. The airport has transitioned to other uses such as training activities, aviation fairs and civil use, while some parts are to be transformed into a public park.

GREATEST LOGISTIC OPERATION

The transfer from Atatürk Airport was a success story in its own right. In what was said to be the greatest logistic operation in civil aviation history, thousands of tons of equipment, from huge aircraft-towing vehicles to extremely sensitive materials, were ferried across the city. Trucks carried equipment a total distance of 400,000 kilometers, an equivalent of going 10 times around the world. Over 1,800 personnel were employed during the operation.

Scheduled to last 45 hours, the operation was completed in a record time of 33 hours. It began in the early hours of April 5, 2019, and was completed on April 6, 2019, in the afternoon.

The airport – a pinpoint megaproject by the ruling Justice and Development Party (AK Party) – was initially launched over a need for meeting the ever-growing demand from around the world, relieving air traffic with a strong infrastructure and large capacity.

Completed in 42 months, the first phase of the airport was built with a cost of 6 billion euros ($6.72 billion) with a public-private partnership (PPP) model by a consortium of Turkey's leading contractors Limak, Kolin, Cengiz, Mapa and Kalyon. The consortium will pay 1.1 billion euros annually for 25 years. The project represents a total economic size of 32.4 billion euros, excluding taxes. This figure constitutes an investment cost of 10.2 billion euros and 22.2 billion euros for rental costs to be paid to the government.

Before its establishment, there were two airports in one of the world's most crowded cities, Sabiha Gökçen Airport on Istanbul's Anatolian side and Atatürk Airport on the European side. Atatürk Airport served some 68 million passengers in 2018, its last year, while Sabiha Gökçen has a current capacity to welcome some 31 million passengers a year.

The new airport can handle 90 million passengers a year in the current phase of development, which, while it is a high figure, is nothing compared to its potential capacity to serve 200 million after the completion of all phases.

It served some 40.47 million passengers in its first year, while it reached its 50 millionth passenger on Dec. 23.

Once fully operational, it will be the world's largest in terms of the number of passengers. All four phases of the airport's construction and expansion, including six runways, are expected to be completed by 2028.

Transportation and Infrastructure Minister Cahit Turhan in October said the construction of the third parallel runway at the airport in the area of 76.5 million square meters located on the coast of the Black Sea between Yeniköy and Akpınar regions was nearing an end.

He said the runway is expected to be put into service in the summer of 2020 and with the opening of the runway, the Triple Parallel Runway Operation used in just a few airports in the world will be implemented.

An east-west runway and a parallel taxiway will also be built in the second stage. The second terminal building of approximately 450,000 square meters will be put into service when the number of passengers reaches 80 million and an additional parallel runway with parallel taxiways and an additional apron are said to be used in this process.

When the number of passengers reaches 110 million, a new satellite terminal of 170,000 square meters is planned to be put into service at the end of the fourth stage.

The airport will eventually be able to host more than 100 airlines and operate 3,500 flights per day to about 350 destinations worldwide, making the city an aviation hub that has already seen an increasing demand thanks to its strategic location and as being a center for connecting flights.

ENVIRONMENT-FRIENDLY AVIATION CENTER

The Istanbul Airport project is not only drawing attention as a travel hub. It also contains and uses state-of-the-art technology and has earned a reputation for its environmental awareness policies in line with international standards.

The airport's terminal building, which has continued to improve its sustainability since the design phase, was built to provide 24% more energy efficiency and 40% more water efficiency than conventional systems. Moreover, within the ""Climate Change Adaptation and Action Plan,"" the airport has been adapted to climate change.

One policy implemented in the airport to create an environmentally friendly workplace for operators and businesses is the waste sorting system. This policy was part of the Zero Waste Declaration signed by the CEOs of 18 main stakeholders under the leadership of the airport's operator IGA. Accordingly, the waste is divided into five categories, paper/cardboard, packaging, glass, organic and domestic waste, allowing for proper recycling.

A GLOBAL HUB BETWEEN ASIA, AFRICA AND EUROPE

Istanbul Airport has already won several international awards, including the International Airport Reviews' (IAR) ""Readers' Choice: Airport of the Year"" award. The editor of the U.K.-based magazine, Tara Nolan, pointed out that the new airport in Istanbul serves ""as a global hub between Asia, Africa and Europe.""

The award was given to Istanbul Airport from among several other popular international airports, including London Heathrow Airport, Singapore Changi Airport, Copenhagen Airport, Canada's Vancouver Airport, Australia's Sydney Airport and Hong Kong International Airport.

The airport was also awarded during the Dec. 16-18, 2016 World Architecture Festival held in Berlin for the design of its terminal building under the category of ""Upcoming Projects- Infrastructure."" The terminal building is the world's largest terminal building with a single roof."	https://www.dailysabah.com/tourism/2020/01/01/state-of-art-istanbul-airport-to-display-aviation-hub-potential-in-2020

Active	"The Government of Bangladesh is building its first nuclear power plant in Rooppur on the east side of the river Padma near Ishwardi in the Pabna district of Bangladesh.

The project is being implemented by the Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission (BAEC), under the guidance of Science and Technology Ministry of the Government of Bangladesh. The nuclear power plant (NPP) will include two units, Rooppur Unit-1 and Rooppur Unit-2 with a capacity of 1.2GW each.

Foundation stone for the Rooppur NPP was laid in October 2013 and the first concrete for the main construction phase was poured in November 2017. The main construction of Unit-2 began in July 2018, with the pouring of the first concrete.

Rooppur Unit-1 is scheduled to commence operations in 2023, while Rooppur Unit-2 is due to come online in 2024.

The Rooppur nuclear power plant will use cutting-edge technologies and follow the safety guidelines of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The IAEA supported the country in the assessment of sites and development of a radioactive waste management system for the nuclear power programme.

The project will provide low-cost electricity and create new jobs in Bangladesh. The power production in Bangladesh currently exceeds 4GW a year. The new plant will increase the country’s power production and enable it to achieve energy independence.

Rooppur nuclear power plant details

Rooppur NPP will be equipped with two VVER-1200 water-cooled, water-moderated power reactors of the AES-2006 / V-392M design.

“The nuclear power plant (NPP) will include two units, Rooppur Unit-1 and Rooppur Unit-2 with a capacity of 1.2GW each.”

Each reactor unit comprises a reactor and four circulation loops, with each loop including circulation pipelines, a reactor coolant pump and horizontal steam generator.

Nominal thermal power of the reactor is 3.2GW, while the maximum utilisation factor is more than 90%. The time of fuel operation cycle in the reactor is between four and five years.

The main equipment of the Rooppur nuclear power plant will have a service life of more than 60 years, without the need for replacement.

The power plant will also include meteorological and water gauge stations, permanent seismic stations, as well as storage and laboratory facilities.

Rooppur NPP construction details

Construction of the nuclear power plant was divided into stages, including the preparatory and main stages. The preparatory construction stage work was carried out during 2015-2016. It included the construction of amenities and office buildings, roads, security fences and storage facilities.

The main construction works include excavation works, the pit water removal system, development of pit for units one and two, soil stabilisation works and foundations for both reactor units.

In March 2018, a trilateral agreement was signed to allow Indian companies to take part in construction and installation works for the project. Indian firms can also supply non-critical equipment, according to the memorandum of understanding.

Financing

Russia agreed to provide a $500m loan to Bangladesh for the project’s on-site engineering studies, project development and personnel training.

Rooppur NPP safety features

The Rooppur NPP incorporates the defence-in-depth protection, which is a multi-layer protection and mitigation system. Any human or man-made accidents can be mitigated using the system ensuring safety to the environment.

The system includes five layers of barriers, which will prevent radiation exposure, as well as protect people and the environment.

Rooppur nuclear power plant contractors

JSC Atomstroyexport, a subsidiary of Rosatom, was appointed as a general contractor by BAEC for the project. The contractual scope includes the supply of equipment and materials and nuclear fuel, as well as providing training to the project management team.

A $79.3m contract was awarded to Inter RAO Engineering for pit excavation of the main buildings and construction and erection of facilities for the plant.

Goldenberg Group of Companies was awarded the civil construction and pipe laying works contract.

Orgenergostroy carried out a comprehensive engineering survey for the plant and constructed the pilot bases and residential camps for the contractors.

Active	"The fast-track Padma railway link project is likely to face another blow as the Bangladesh Railway (BR) has sought to lower its current annual allocation for it in the development budget, officials said on Wednesday.

The government had allocated Tk 39.95 billion for the mega project in the annual development programme (ADP) for the current fiscal year (FY), 2019-20.

But the state-run railway has now sought Tk 33.05 billion in the upcoming revised annual development programme (RADP), which is 17 per cent lower than the original outlay, as it has failed to meet the annual project implementation target, said the officials.

The BR is scheduled to complete the Padma Bridge railway link project by June 2024 at a cost of Tk 392.47 billion.

Of the total project cost, Tk 210.26 billion is being provided by the Chinese government.

A BR official said they would need less funds this fiscal as it saw delays in land acquisition and in preparing detailed design.

Although the BR proposed slashing the fund allocation in the upcoming RADP, it would require bigger funds in the FY 2021 ADP as it expects to see better progress in the future, he added.

Meanwhile, the BR has so far implemented about 33 per cent of the total project work even as four years have been elapsed since January 2016, the project inception period, officials said.

Another official said the BR signed a Tk 247.49 billion commercial contract in August 2016 with Chinese company-China Railway Group Limited (CRGL) --for installing 172 km broad-gauge single railway track on both sides of the Padma Bridge, the longest bridge of the country.

But it took nearly two years for the commercial contract to take effect due to the delay in signing the loan agreement with the Chinese loan provider, the Exim Bank.

The Tk 210.26 billion loan contract was signed in April 2018 with the EXIM Bank.

The BR officials said the contractor, CRGL, has taken too much time to start the pile load tests on the 172 km railway track alignment.

When asked, a Planning Commission official said, ""The Padma Railway link project is one of the highest priority projects of the government for which we try to allocate adequate funds the implementing agencies seek.""

""As per the BR's requirement, we allocated Tk 39.95 billion in the current original ADP,"" he said.

But now the BR is surrendering more than 17 per cent of its available funds in the pipeline as it has failed to implement its targeted work, he told the FE.

It means the completion of the project will be delayed further, he added.

The government has attached highest priority to the construction of the Padma Bridge, with road communication on the top and the railway connections in the lower portion of the 6.15-kilometre structure.

Active	"Currently under construction at an altitude of 2,640 meters on Mount Ovit in Rize's İkizdere district, the Ovit Tunnel, Turkey's second longest and the world's fourth longest highway tunnel stretching 14,300 meters in length, is slated for completion and will be put into service by the end of the year. The project will facilitate freight transportation and boost connectivity mechanisms between the region and neighboring countries, as well as major ports.

Plans for the Ovit Tunnel, which was brought to the agenda as the Rize-Erzurum Highway and Tunnel Project in the development plans of the Ottoman State in 1880, were laid out on May 13, 2012 under then-Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's leadership. A ceremony titled the ""Light at the End of the Tunnel"" was held on Nov. 11, 2016 with Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım in attendance.

The Ovit Tunnel will serve as the fourth longest tunnel in the world and second longest in Turkey with a total length of 14,300 kilometers, including 369 meters of ""avalanche tunnel,"" second only to the 14,500-kilometer long New Zigana Tunnel which is currently under construction on the Trabzon-Gümüşhane highway.

The tunnel's entrance altitude will be 1,919 meters with an exit altitude of 2,363 meters, with a longitudinal slope of 2.13. While excavations for the 1,710-meter long roadway approaching the tunnel have neared completion, the remaining concrete production in the 1,400-meter long ""avalanche tunnel"" will be completed by the end of the year.

In tunnel construction, where 90 percent of hardware work is completed, 773 people continue to work in shifts.

The Rize-Erzurum Highway project, for which superstructure and bridge crossing works have already been launched, is slated to be commissioned by the end of the year.

The Ovit Pass will be open all year-round upon completion of the tunnel, which will eliminate the former five-month-long closure annually due to heavy snowfall and avalanche dangers. Currently, the route is frequented by an average of 1,135 vehicles passing from İkizdere to İspir on a daily basis during the seven months of the year that the route is open.

Built as a double tube and estimated to cost about TL 1.1 billion, the Ovit Tunnel will be an important alternative to other roads connecting the Black Sea to eastern and southeastern Anatolia.

As a result of the commissioning of the tunnel, the Rize-Erzurum Highway will be reduced in length from 250 kilometers to 200 kilometers.

Ovit Tunnel to revive domestic tourism

Rize Chamber of Commerce and Industry (RTSO) Chairman Şaban Aziz Karamehmetoğlu stated that 7,000 containers can potentially be shipped to the region with activation of the Organized Industrial Zone that is under construction in the vicinity of the Ovit Tunnel, suggesting that with the completion of the tunnel, the Rize-Artvin Airport which is currently under construction, as well as logistical projects, will offer the eastern Black Sea region crucially strategic transfer hubs.

Indicating that this will have major contributions on the lives of locals in the region, he said that local merchants and industrialists should evaluate their potential gains.

Karamehmetoğlu also underlined that the Ovit Tunnel will provide major tourism returns in addition to its contribution to trade in the Black Sea and eastern regions of Turkey. ""In pre-tunnel surveys, we have seen that 97 percent of people have never traveled to the 16 provinces in the east and do not know these areas, in a cultural sense,"" he said. ""In recent years, visitors have begun to come to our province. The Ovit Tunnel will offer a brand new alternative in the domestic tourism movement.""

An exemplary tunnel for Turkey

The lighting and interior design of the Ovit Tunnel are being projected as a model of exemplary production in Turkey.

While lighting in other tunnels in Turkey is typically provided with one channel, lighting in the Ovit Tunnel will be specially designed via a double channel, eliminating the dangers of lack of visibility and lack of attention among drivers due to the length of the tunnel.

Additionally, the inside of the tunnel will be painted with red stripes on white backgrounds to increase safety, while rest areas along the motorway will be specially painted and illuminated, preventing the loss of visibility among drivers in the 14,300-kilometer-long tunnel and offering them comfortable places to pull over.

Karamehmetoğlu told Anadolu Agency (AA) that the Ovit Mountain is the biggest landmass between the Turkish Black Sea coast and the east, asserting that this obstacle will be removed with the tunnel.

Noting that the tunnel will be put into service by the end of 2017, Karamehmetoğlu said the Ovit Tunnel Project is not only a project affecting the Rize-Erzurum region but also all 16 provinces in Turkey's east, adding that it will serve as a route that will be the exit point for these cities.

Pointing out that Turkey has made very serious investments in the Southeastern Anatolia Project (GAP) in recent years, Karamehmetoğlu stressed that products in this region should be marketed to the Black Sea region as well as second-world countries, adding that the Rize-Erzurum Ovit Mountain Road offers drivers a shortcut for moving products from Turkey's southeast to ports along the coast.

Tunnel to facilitate freight shipments

The Ovit Tunnel is located in a strategic region of eastern Turkey and will be linked to ports from which goods are exported to neighboring countries. Moreover, the tunnel will ease transportation to the Baku-Tiflis-Kars Railway, which will be operational by the end of the summer.

The highway tunnel, which will connect Rize's İkizdere district and Erzurum's İspir district in northeastern Turkey, is also expected to reinvigorate the historic Silk Road. When connected to other road projects, the tunnel will help provide an uninterrupted link between the Silk Road and the Ural Mountains, offering easy access to the Baku-Tiflis-Kars Railway, connecting Turkey to Northern China and constituting an important part of the middle corridor on the One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative that aims to revive the ancient Silk Road.

Such infrastructural transportation projects are believed to reveal the region's trade potential. In that regard, the tunnel is expected to make Erzurum a warehouse and storage hub that is connected to ports; hence, facilitating freight shipment to neighboring countries."	https://www.dailysabah.com/business/2017/06/23/137-year-old-dream-realized-with-ovit-tunnel

Bangladesh Railway’s other priority project Metro Rail work halted due to shortage of workers

Two of the government’s top priority projects – Padma Multi-Purpose Bridge and Padma Bridge Rail Link Project – continues to progress even at a time when the entire country has come to a standstill due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak.

Although most of the government’s fast track projects came to a halt due to the pandemic, Chinese contractors tasked with the two mega projects have kept the wheels turning for the two mega projects.

However, the pace of the progress in the two projects has slowed down significantly due to the shortage of Bangladeshi workers.

The Chinese contractors said adequate safety measures have been taken in view of the pandemic to keep the work uninterrupted.

“The Padma Bridge Rail Link Project and Padma Multipurpose Bridge Project have been continuing progress despite the coronavirus outbreak,” Wang Kun, spokesperson of China Railway Group Limited (CREC), the contractor of Padma Bridge Rail Link Project, said in a statement.

“CREC has been making huge efforts to provide a safe working environment for its workers to ensure that they do not contract Covid-19 from the workplace,” he added.

“For its 9,000-member strong workforce in Bangladesh, the company has already procured masks, protective suits, Covid-19 test kits, goggles, hand gloves, infrared thermometers, disinfectants, hand-sanitizers and various kinds of medicines from China and local market. All of these resources are now being used to ensure zero infection among its Chinese and local staff,” said Wang Kun, in a press release.

However, site engineers say that a quarter of the workforce was actually working on the site since the pandemic began.

Besides, the last pier of the bridge among the 42 piers was installed last week. Moreover, the 28th span of the Padma Multipurpose Bridge has installed on Saturday morning.

Now, all the piers spanning 4.2km of the 6.15km-long bridge have become visible on the Padma river site.

“The construction work has been going on amid the coronavirus outbreak,” said Bangladesh Bridge Authority Executive Engineer Dewan Abdul Quader.

At the same time, Railway Minister Nurul Islam Sujan told the Dhaka Tribune: “The Padma Bridge Rail link project continues to progress in the consultation with the Bangladesh Army and by ensuring social distancing.

“However, Bangladesh Railway’s other priority project, including the Chittagong-Cox’s Bazar Rail Link project has been halted by the local administration,” he added.

Not only railway projects, most infrastructure development projects have been halted as the government enforced social distancing across the country through the district administration with assistance from the armed forces to combat the spread of coronavirus.

The Metro Rail, which had been marked as another priority project of the government, has also been halted due to the outbreak.

Officials of the projects said construction work of metro rail MRT line-6, between Uttara to Motijheel, has been facing trouble due to the shortage of workers. Most of the workers on the project had left Dhaka for their ancestral homes after the government announced a public holiday from March 26 onwards.

Later, the government extended the public holiday twice to April 25.

Of the eight packages of the Metro Rail project, six packages were directly related to physical construction, which have been completely suspended due to the coronavirus outbreak.

“Around 500 foreign officials are working under the project. However, the absence of Bangladeshi workers on the site has interrupted the progress,” Dhaka Mass Transit Company Ltd (MRT line-6) Additional Project Director (Civil) Abdul Baquee Miah said."	https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/2020/04/12/padma-bridge-rail-link-project-continues-amid-coronavirus-outbreak

To be operated with a minimum utilization factor of 92%, the Rooppur NPP will support base-load power generation in the country, over its estimated operational life of 50 years.

Rooppur power plant location and background

The project is located in the Rooppur village, approximately 160km from the country’s capital Dhaka and 27km away from the nearby town Pabna.

Although the Rooppur nuclear power plant was originally planned in the 1960’s, the project took off only after a strategic co-operation agreement for the development was signed between the Russian Federation and the Government of Bangladesh in November 2011.

Detailed engineering design and site preparatory works for the project were completed by the end of 2013.

The Bangladesh Atomic Energy Regulatory Authority (BAERA) issued license for the design and construction of the Rooppur units one and two in November 2017 and July 2018, respectively.

Rooppur power plant make-up and safety features

The Rooppur nuclear power facility will comprise two VVER pressurized water reactor (PWR) units of 1,200MW gross capacity each. Each unit will consist of a pressurized water-cooled power reactor with four circulation loops and a horizontal steam generator to drive the steam turbines inside the turbine building.

Uranium-235 enriched up to 5% will be used as fuel inside the reactor core, which will be enclosed within a steel-lined cylindrical pressure vessel.

Further, the reactor pressure vessel will be enclosed within a steel lined inner containment and two layers of concrete containment of 1.5m and 0.5m thickness, respectively.

Safety features of the reactors include boron injection systems for emergency shutdown, molten catcher, gas removal and spray systems, along with overpressure protection measures, as well as emergency power supply with the help of a standby diesel power generator. The plant uses gadolinium oxide with natural content of isotopes as the integrated burnable absorber.

Power transmission

The electricity generated at the NPP will be transmitted through a 609km-long 400kV double-circuit power transmission line connecting Bogra, Gopalganj, Dhaka and Dhamrai, and a 60km-long 230kV double-circuit connecting Rooppur and Baghabari.

Estimated to cost $1.3bn, the transmission infrastructure for the project will also include three substations and 12 bay extensions.

Financing

The Russian Federation agreed to provide an initial loan assistance of $500m towards the preparatory stage construction activities of the Rooppur nuclear power plant in July 2013. Russia agreed to provide another $11.38bn for the main construction works of the plant, in July 2016.

Key stations at Jhakarkati Bus Station, Kanpur Central Railway Station, and Naubasta will be connected through this corridor. The Rawatpur Railway station will serve as an interchange.

The corridor between Agriculture University and Barra-8 will pass through eight stations, including Kakadeo, Vijay Nagar Chauraha, Shastri Chowk, and Govind Nagar. It will connect densely populated residential areas. Four of the stations will be elevated while the remaining four will be underground.

The 9km-long priority section will include nine elevated stations. The stations will be IIT-Kanpur, Kalyanpur Railway station, SPM Hospital, and CSJM University, Gurudev Chauraha, Geeta Nagar, Rawatpur Railway station, Lala Lajpat Rai Hospital, and Moti Jheel.

Kanpur Metro project infrastructure

Kanpur Metro will have a standard gauge track of 1,435mm that will support operations at a maximum speed of 90km/h.

The metro system will feature pedestrian facilities, open bicycle-sharing systems, and feeder transportation facility. The corridors in the first phase will have a total parking area of 161,950m².

Proposed facilities to improve the movement of pedestrians are skywalks, pathways, subways and foot over bridges.

Stations will have toilets, security rooms, changing room and retail spaces. The project will also feature the construction of maintenance depot and workshop.

Financing for Kanpur Metro project

The national and state governments will partly finance the Kanpur Metro project. The project will also secure financing from international funding organisations.

In its budget for 2020-21, the Uttar Pradesh Government approved an allocation of Rs3.58bn ($49.87m) for phase one of the project.

The Kanpur Metro project is anticipated to receive funding from the European Investment Bank (EIB).

In 2016, a team of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) assessed the project and expressed an interest to offer funding."	https://www.railway-technology.com/projects/kanpur-metro-uttar-pradesh/

Having had their freedom of movement blighted for many years by wintertime snow blocking the D925 highway, along with narrower roads and passes, at Mount Ovit, residents of eastern Anatolia must have been hugely relieved two years ago when 325 Sandvik drill-rigs deployed by the CMA contracting joint venture began driving under Mount Ovit at the start of the Ovit Tunnel project. Currently the main transport to the region from the main Turkish business cities of Ankara and Istanbul is restricted to air, water via the Black Sea coast, and a long coastal road. But now the countdown is on to complete a tunnel road link planned since 1880, more than 40 years before the end of the Ottoman Empire. The current D925 highway was constructed in 1930 over Mount Ovit pass at 2,600m above sea level, and needed 1,500 workers to complete it.



The new improved €150 million D925 highway project will link Ikizdere, in Rize Province, and Ispir, in Erzurum Province, for the first time providing an all-year, all-weather link and boosting the local economies.



In addition to various road improvement projects along the route, the Ovit Tunnel is the key element in the new link. It comprises two 14.7km long tubes and, on completion, will be the longest tunnel in Turkey and the fourth longest globally.



The tunnel plan is mainly straight with slight curves at each end to reach the optimum portal positions. The two bores are connected by crosscuts at intervals of 250m to enable escape routes and to provide services accommodation. In profile there will be a grade, chiefly to facilitate drainage, of 3.5% for the first 7km from the main northwest portal, and of 1.0% for 5.5km from the other portal. At the high point, 2,500m above sea level, there will be a 1,700m long drive, 8m square in order to facilitate emergency egress and ventilation. This replaces the original plan for an access shaft as it was decided this would be too deep and difficult to access high up in the mountainous terrain.



Contractor CMA ( 4144 Cengiz Insaat and 3340 Makyol) is responsible for the whole tunnel and highway construction project, and the client and owner is TCK, the Turkish national General Directorate of Highways.

The project management structure is substantially affected by the two construction sites, at each tunnel portal, being remote from each other, especially in winter. Thus the site at the south-east portal has its own tunnelling and mechanical chiefs: Ferhat ahinba and Murat Ozan respectively. The project is led on site by Alper Eryiit as project manager, supported by chief engineer Kerim Tütüncü. In the management structure under Kerim Tütüncü there is Muharrem Tezcan as tunnelling chief engineer and Sedat Seker as chief mechanical service engineer.



Of the joint venture participants, Makyol has 42 years of experience in many heavy construction projects, making it one of the oldest and most experienced contractors in Turkey with many completed highway projects. Makyol also has international experience in Albania, Algeria, Azerbaijan, Iraq, Morocco, and Oman.



Tunnelling and mining specialist Cengiz was founded in 1980 and has been involved in many tunnelling, highway, mining and infrastructure projects, including work in Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Iraq as well as throughout Turkey.



The two tunnels are actually being driven as four drives with two partial faces in each. The full excavation dimensions of each horseshoe-shape drive are 8.4m height x 11.78m width, plus trenches on each side to provide space for future drains. First a top heading is driven to a height of 5.9m followed by a bench of 2.5m height, a contractual distance of 250m behind. A ramp between the two facilitates access for the drill-rig and mucking out.



Most of the tunnelling is carried out by drill-and-blast using four Sandvik DT820 rigs with standard manual controls, one for each of the current main tunnel excavation drives. However the rigs also carry out any necessary rock bolting and excavation of crosscuts between the two bores.



The decision to go for Sandvik Construction equipment is attributed to both a strong relationship between Sandvik Construction Turkey and the Cengiz Group, but the delivery times for the ordered rigs were also very important. In addition to the four tunnelling and one surface drill rig used on the Mount Ovit site, Sandvik has also sold another three tunnelling rigs and a surface rig to Cengiz for a tunnelling project in Bosnia-Herzegovina.



The Sandvik Construction Turkey tunnelling team, consisting of Erdinç Çetin, Ouz Arslan and Burak Özgür, most closely associated with the Mount Ovit project, said that the 1700m new access drive to the centre of the main tunnel drives will enable CMA to test the newer DT921i tunnelling drill rig. This will be equipped with Sandvik’s advanced iSURE control software for fully automatic operation requiring minimal human intervention. Then, CMA will transfer the DT921i rig to granite faces in the south-east end of the planned tunnel.



In addition to the four DT820 tunnelling drill rigs, a Sandvik DX700 top-hammer surface-drilling rig has been employed to excavate rock from the portals and associated cuttings.

There is a long tradition of drill-and-blast tunnelling in Turkey, and for such an important project CMA needed the best. “We were looking first for well qualified operators,” said Alper Eryiit. “But sometimes training is necessary for which Sandvik is supporting us.”



Most of the rock to be excavated is expected to be granitic, both standard granite and porphyritic, or basalt, generally making good ground for drill-and-blast tunnelling. However there are some fracture zones between the main rock masses.



CMA employs Sandvik ballistic bits of 45mm diameter for blast holes, and 51mm in diameter for rock-bolt holes. Using 4.9m-long drill rods, each round is drilled to a depth of up to 4.5m. This achieves an advance of 7-8m per day on all four current faces. As of early 2014, some 6.2km of advance had been achieved, in totalling all four faces. Blasting is scheduled twice a day, usually meaning that there is a blast every 12-hour working shift.



The joint venture’s mechanical maintenance chief, Sedat eker, said that the hard and abrasive rock had taken some toll of drill consumables. Even so, on average each blast hole bit lasts 400-600m without grinding. “Earlier there had been shank breakage problems while drilling in the very hard rock, but since the adoption of the new design (Sandvik Alpha 330) of rock tools, there have been no more problems.”



Sandvik Construction Turkey’s rock tools sales engineer Ouzhan Öztürk said, “While they were using R38-R32 standard rock tools they had really big shank adaptor and rod failure problems due to very hard rock conditions - the very hard granite. Most of the rod failures were because of the bending of the rods in the deviated holes. That was also the reason of the shank adapter failures.”



“After that, we tested the new Alpha 330 rock tools at the site, and with these tools they have minimised the hole deviation problems and consequently minimised the rod and especially shank adapter failures.”



“Now, they are using only Alpha 330 tools for their underground drill rigs. This system has decreased their consumption, especially for rods and shank adapters, accelerated the drilling process, increased the hole quality which, in turn, is increasing the blasting efficiency and at the end decreasing the whole tunnelling process costs.”



Alpha 330 rock tools are designed especially for 45mm-diameter drilling with high-power (20kW+) drills. Sandvik’s particular expertise in steel metallurgy together with state-of-the-art CAD/CAM procedures has resulted in optimised geometry resulting in higher stiffness and longer service life than the earlier R32 design, also a Sandvik innovation.

Project manager Alper Eryiit of CMA said that although the rock is generally massive and hard, it can be variable. “There are about 70 metres of soft ground at the portals, requiring special support measures. The rock was very abrasive between 300 and 350 metres in from the northwest portal. It took about four hours to drill a round until 250 metres, but on hitting the granite from 250 metres it took three-and-a-half hours. I would prefer moderate rock conditions for optimum progress, with two-and-a-half hours to drill a round rather than the three-and-a-half to four hours in granite. But the rock is changing and we are quite okay now. Overall we expect 75% of the drives to be in granite and 25-45% in basalt.”



CMA tunnelling chief Muharrem Tezcan reported that the normal drill patterns included 100-140 blast holes in the top-heading wedge cut, and 40-50 parallel holes in the bench. He explained that the blasting itself employs micro gel-style explosive in 38mm-diameter capsules as these produce lower air pollution, allowing the face to be approached earlier for support work and mucking out. Around 200kg is used in each top-heading blast. Initiation uses one electronic detonator attached to a non-electric circuit.



At the south-east portal there is up to 350m of overburden superficial and a large fracture zone, making tunnelling more problematic. “We have suffered from water penetration and collapses,” said Eryiit. “The ground has changed to basalt with an alteration and fracture zone, but we are still continuing with drill-and-blast. Basalt actually occurs at both ends.”



To a considerable extent, the CMA tunnelling team has to be ready to tackle whatever it encounters. Eryiit added, “There has been limited site investigation due to the great overburden, of up to 900 metres, meaning that there would be long investigation hole lengths with difficult access. This is partially why we are keen to check the performance of intelligent jumbos in the emergency access drive.”



Sandvik tunnelling team member Erdinç Çetin added, “Sandvik iSURE offers many more possibilities to check hole length and drilling performance. It gives far better control of the whole drilling and blasting process and therefore gives good opportunities for process performance improvement.”



A typical tunnelling cycle starts with drilling the top-heading first followed by blasting and loading out. The newly blasted surfaces are scaled with an excavator-mounted hydraulic breaker. Then a primary lining of sprayed concrete, reinforced with polypropylene fibres, is applied up to the face for safety. Next the bench face undergoes the same sequence.



Meanwhile systematic rock bolting, using the Sandvik DT820 drill-rigs, is carried out up to 15m behind the face, together with welded steel-mesh sheet installation and fibre-reinforced sprayed concrete according to the determined rock type. Split-set-type rock bolts are normally installed.



Although the more difficult rock types necessitate increasing measures such as higher rock bolt density and thicker sprayed concrete, the most unstable zones require different approaches. In soft rock and zones with high overburden self-drilling anchors (SDAs) are used to avoid having the drill hole stand open before installing the bolt. Using SDAs the drill-bit employed is sacrificial and the rebar drill steel is grouted in place immediately to secure early support.

In addition, within the ‘overburden area’ umbrella support is installed with lengths of rebar over the next stretches to be excavated. In all cases the versatile Sandvik DT820 drill rigs carry out all drilling and bolt installation.



CMA has its own workshops and maintenance crew on site, but supported in the case of drilling equipment by Sandvik. Frequently used consumables and service parts such as drill requirements and machine filters are stocked in the sites at both ends of the tunnel route but larger or less frequently needed parts are supplied by Sandvik from its depot in Trabzon. CMA uses original parts for all drill rig requirements.



CMA chief of mechanical maintenance Sedat eker said, “We are quite happy with Sandvik’s performance in service and that of the equipment. There is usually same-day service response from the Trabzon depot.”



Two spare drills are available on site to permit overhauls in the workshops every 500 hours of operation.



If view of the remote location of the sites, all workers usually remain in site accommodation, working 13 days out of 14 on 12-hour shifts.



The support elements described earlier provide the required support during construction and as a base for the final structure. CMA will install cast-in-place concrete to a depth of 460mm using travelling formwork made in Turkey. First, however, a plastic waterproofing membrane is installed over a smooth layer of sprayed concrete. This provides a drainage passage to the main drains to be installed at the foot of each tunnel wall alongside service ducts.



CMA mobilised on its two construction sites and camps in 2012 with a groundbreaking ceremony on 12 May attended by national and local dignitaries. The tunnel is scheduled to be open for traffic in November or December 2015, in time for the winter snows, necessitating tunnelling to be complete by the mid-summer of that year."	https://www.worldhighways.com/wh10/feature/sandviks-turkish-delight-groundbreaking-tunnel-vision

DHAKA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The 29th span of Bangladesh's largest Chinese-built Padma bridge has been installed amid the country's nationwide COVID-19 lockdown, making 4.35 km of the main structure of the bridge visible.

Dewan Abdul Quader, a senior Bangladeshi engineer of the Padma Multipurpose Bridge Project, told journalists that engineers of China Railway Major Bridge Engineering Group Co., Ltd (MBEC) on Monday morning successfully installed the span.

The around 3,200-ton span was placed on the pillars 19 and 20 of the bridge, he said.

With the installation of the 150-meter long span, the 29th span among the 41 spans has been installed on the 6.15-km bridge and 4.35 km of the bridge is now visible.

Despite the COVID-19 outbreak, many Chinese-built major projects including Padma Bridge are still under regular construction in the country.

According to the project engineer, the next span of the bridge is likely to be installed later this month as MBEC continued efforts to ensure timely completion of the core structure of the bridge despite the COVID-19 outbreak that has kept Bangladesh under the lockdown since March 26.

Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina inaugurated the main works of Padma Bridge project, the biggest of its kind in the country, in December 2015.

Apart from connecting nearly 30 million people in Bangladesh's southwest region to the rest of the country, the bridge will enhance regional trade and collaboration along the Asian highway No. 1 and the Trans-Asian railway network."	http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-05/04/c_139030050.htm
Active	"The Padma Bridge is a multipurpose railroad bridge to be constructed across the Padma River in Bangladesh. The bridge will connect Mawa with Janjira, linking the south-west of the country to the northern and eastern regions. The Bangladesh Bridge Authority (BBA) is the executing agency of the project.

A feasibility study conducted by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) anticipated that the volume of traffic on the Padma Bridge will reach 21,300 vehicles a day upon the bridge’s opening and 41,600 vehicles a day by 2025.

The BBA invited pre-qualification tenders for the $2.92bn bridge construction project in April 2010. Construction was expected to begin in early 2011 and complete by the end of 2015. But following the alleged irregularities in the bidding process, the World Bank suspended $1.2bn funding for the project in October 2011. The bridge is expected to be the longest river crossing in South Asia..

The project is expected to generate employment opportunities for more than 743,000 people in the region.

Padma Bridge construction project

The Padma Bridge project has been undertaken with the main aim of improving the social, economic and industrial development of the south-west region of Bangladesh.

The project also aims to provide the people in the south-west region with improved access to markets and services throughout the rest of the country while accelerating growth in Bangladesh as a whole.

“The bridge is expected to be the longest river crossing in South Asia.”

The Padma River divides the south-west zone from the northern and eastern regions of Bangladesh. Construction of the river crossing will reduce the distance from the south-west region to Dhaka, the country’s capital, by more than 100km, and will also bring savings in passenger and commodity movement time and costs. The bridge will ensure easier communication between the regions, and will also help in expanding education and training facilities.

In addition, the project will improve the gross domestic product (GDP) of the south-west region by 2%, thus increasing the nation’s GDP by 1.2%. It will also reduce river bank erosion and replace the dangerous ferry and launch operation between the south-west region and Dhaka.

Padma Bridge design

The bridge design contract was awarded to a team led by Maunsell AECOM, the New Zealand business of AECOM. The design team also includes experts from Northwest Hydraulic Consultants, SMEC International, ACE Consultants, Aas Jakobsen and HR Wallingford.

The bridge will be approximately 6.15km long and 21.1m wide. It will be a double deck composite steel truss structure and will use 41 piers. The main spans will be 150m long. The upper deck will contain a four-lane highway, while the lower deck will house a rail line (to be built in the future), gas transmission pipeline, optic-fibre cable and power transmission lines.

The detailed design of the project was given the 2010 award for Best Safeguard Planning System by the Asian Development Bank (ADB).

Bridge construction

“The project should generate employment for over 743,000 people in the region.”

In April 2011, the Government of Bangladesh initiated the process of shortlisting the contractors for the bridge construction. The tenders were called in June 2011. In August 2011, the bidding process was stalled by the World Bank after the alleged irregularities in the bidding process and in October the World Bank funding for the project was suspended.

Apart from bridge construction, the project will also involve construction of 15.1km of approach roads (2.3km on Mawa side and 12.8km on Janjira side), toll plazas, and facilities for dredging and river bank protection. River control works are under way.

Contractors

The tender evaluation committee recommended a $50m contract to Canada-based SNC-Lavalin to supervise construction of the main bridge. The WB’s decision to suspend the funding followed the allegation of irregularities in appointment of the consultant.

The BBA shortlisted the construction supervision consultant based on the financial proposals from HPR and Associates (UK), SNC-Lavalin (Canada), AECOM and Associates (New Zealand), Halcrow and Associates (UK) and Oriental Japan and Associates (Japan).

Finance

In February 2011 the World Bank, the lead financier and coordinating agency of the multi-donor project, approved $1.2bn concessional credit. It has already processed a $3m Project Preparation Facility to start the preparatory works.

The World Bank has also financed $60m to ensure better livelihoods for the people residing in the construction zone. Resettlement sites are being developed for the people who have lost homes and livelihood as a result of the project construction.

Other key lenders for the project are the ADB ($615m), the JICA ($400m), the Islamic Development Bank ($120m), the Abu Dhabi Development Group ($30m) and the Government of Bangladesh.

However, Japanese lending is expected to be delayed as the lending institutes are focused on rebuilding activities in Japan following the major earthquake and tsunami of March 2011."	https://www.roadtraffic-technology.com/projects/padma-bridge/

Dedicated treatment facilities to be set up for foreigners, local staff

The government has instructed the Dhaka Mass Transit Company Ltd (DMTCL) to gear up the construction work of the metro rail project (Uttara-Kamalpur) amid the pandemic.

Since March, construction work of the metro rail project has remained suspended. There was little progress at the depot with the government decreeing a public holiday across the country.

According to the DMTCL, only 1% progress was reported in the last three months, with total progress currently being at 45%. Plans had been announced earlier regarding the inauguration of the metro rail by December 16, 2021 to mark the golden jubilee of Bangladesh’s Victory Day.

Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader, at a virtual meeting yesterday with officials concerned, issued instructions on an acceleration of the construction work as it was a top priority project of the government.

“Construction work at public places [of the project] was closed off due to the spread of coronavirus in the country but work continued on a limited scale at the depot and over the viaduct,” said Quader.

“Now, the tempo of the work should be accelerated as it is the first tract project of the government. Along with work from home and assignment, field work must be geared up,” he added.

Dedicated treatment facilities for metro rail staff

The government plans to set up dedicated treatment facilities for foreigners working on the metro rail project, as many of them are not prepared yet to do field work due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Additionally, local officials will also be facilitated at the dedicated Covid-19 treatment centres, if necessary.

DMTCL Managing Director MAN Siddique said: “There’s no reason for foreigners not to resume work as construction work has been going on around the globe.”

“We will ensure health facilities and everyone will work by maintaining the health guidelines,” he told Dhaka Tribune.

Allocation decreased for metro rail project

The Finance Division has proposed TK4,370crore for the metro rail project (MRT line-6) for the upcoming fiscal year in light of progress having remained halted for months.

The government has allocated Tk7,212 crore for the ongoing fiscal year, which is effectively Tk2,842 crore less for this year.

However, the DMTCL managing director said though allocation would decrease in the metro rail project in the 2020-21 budget, it could still fulfill demand.

“We are still getting our desired allocation as we had demanded,” he told Dhaka Tribune.

Japan manufacturing four set passenger coaches

The Dhaka Mass Transit Company Ltd (DMTCL) has placed an order with the Japanese metro company for the manufacture of the second, third, fourth, and fifth set of passengers' trains. The first passenger train is ready for shipment.

Obaidul Quader said: “Japan is manufacturing four sets of passenger trains.”

Earlier, MAN Siddique said: “One set of metro trains having six coaches and two engines was ready for shipment on June 15 but was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.""

The DMTCL authorities have already taken an initiative to extend the project from Motijheel to Kamalapur following directives from Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. The length of the extended part will constitute an extra 1.16km.

According to the DMTCL, currently 10.26km out of 11.73km metro rail between Uttara and Agargaon has become visible. Construction of the first phase between Uttara and Agargaon stands at 72% while 40% work has been completed in the second phase (Agargaon to Motijheel) till now.

The DMTCL authorities said electric lines would be installed along with the metro rail lines. There will be a total of 16 stations, starting from Uttara Diabari, named as Uttara North.

The metro rail is projected to carry 60,000 passengers per hour, travelling the entire route of 20km in less than 40 minutes.

According to project details, under the fifth package, a 3.2km viaduct and three metro stations are being built from Agargaon to Karwan Bazar, while a 4.9km metro rail from Karwan Bazar to Motijheel comprising four stations is under construction under the sixth package.

Package 5 under MRT Line 6 is being implemented by a joint venture of Japan’s Pekken Abenikko and Bangladesh’s Abdul Monem Ltd.

Active	"Chittagong-Cox’s Bazar railway line is a proposed 120km dual-gauge passenger line from village in south-east Bangladesh to Cox’s Bazar, one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country.

The greenfield project is one of seven investment sub-projects being undertaken by the Bangladesh Railway (BR) to improve the country’s rail connectivity with other Asian countries.

It is part of Trans-Asian Railway (TAR) network and will improve access to Myanmar and beyond. The project is endorsed by the South Asia Sub regional Economic Cooperation (SASEC).

The project will take five years to complete, and generate employment for approximately 3,500 workers in local communities. It will also enhance trade and tourism in the southern-most parts of the country.

Civil works for the project began in March 2018 and it is expected to be completed by 2022.

Chittagong-Cox’s Bazar rail line route

The first phase of the railway project will include a single-track rail line approximately 102km in length. It will pass through eight sub-districts (upazilas), including the Chandanaish, Satkania and Lohagara sub-divisions in Chittagong district and the Chakaria, Cox’s Bazar Sadar and Ramu sub-divisions in Cox’s Bazar district.

The line will begin at Dohazari village and continue southwards to Cox’s Bazar. The first 29km segment will run across flat, open land in the Chittagong district, while the next 33km will travel through agricultural land and forests in the Chakaria Upazila of Cox’s Bazar District.

During the project’s second phase, the rail line will be extended to the Myanmar border, as well as a planned deep-sea port on Matarbari Island.

Stations along the rail route

A total of eight new stations will be built for the new alignment, in addition to an existing station at Dohazari. The existing station will be demolished to construct a new facility on the opposite side of the tracks, while 2km of existing tracks near the Dohazari station will be renovated.

The proposed line crosses the Sangu River, south of Dohazari. The section of track north of the river will be lifted for sufficient clearance.

Stations will be equipped with relay batteries, generator rooms, sewage and waste management facilities, and energy-saving features such as solar panels. They will feature separate facilities for women, children, elderly and the disabled.

Other infrastructure

A total of 183 water crossings, including 39 bridges and 144 culverts, will be constructed along the new alignment. Six large bridges will be constructed over the Sangu, Matamuhuri and Bakkhali rivers, as well as the Idgaon Chara tributary.

The culverts will offer a single and multi-cell concrete design to enhance drainage.

Financing

The estimated investment for the project is $2.013bn, which includes $512m provided by the Bangladesh Government.

ADB offered a loan of $1.5bn in September 2016 for the project. The first tranche of the loan of approximately $300m was released by ADB in June 2017, while the second tranche of $400m was released in May 2019. The Government of Bangladesh will add $50m to ADB’s second tranche.

The Export-Import Bank of Korea is providing a loan of $99.04m.

Project background and benefits

Chittagong-Cox’s Bazar railway project is expected to connect the national and sub-regional railway networks for the first time.

The new line will connect Cox’s Bazar district to sub-regional markets in order to enhance trade. By providing intermodal facilities for passengers and freight, the project will also improve connections to Myanmar.

With dual-gauge tracks, the project will offer connections to western Bangladesh and India, where most of the railways are broad-gauge, and towards north-eastern India and Southeast Asia, which primarily offer meter-gauge tracks.

The project helps Bangladesh to meet its targets under its 7th Five-Year plan and its railway master plan, which aim to raise the country’s freight market share to 15% and its passenger market share to 10%.

Contractors

The detailed design for the new rail line was provided by SMEC.

The construction of the project has been divided into two lots, Lot 1 and Lot 2. The contract for Lot 1 was awarded to a joint venture (JV) of China Railway Engineering Group (CREC) and Toma Group, while Lot 2 was awarded to a JV of China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) and Max Group. Both the contracts were awarded in September 2017."	https://www.railway-technology.com/projects/chittagong-coxs-bazar-railway-line/
Active	"The Dhaka Metro Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) is a new metro rail system being developed by the Dhaka Mass Transit Company (DMTC) in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

The public transport system will aid in the economic and social development of the greater Dhaka area, which is facing traffic congestion and pollution issues.

A total of five lines, MRT Lines 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6, have been proposed for the project. MRT Line-6 is the first line to be approved under the project and is estimated to cost $2.82bn.

Construction of the A trial operation of the route extending to Agargaon is expected to be conducted towards the end of 2019.

Feasibility studies and environmental impact assessments for the MRT Lines 1 and 5 have been completed.

Dhaka Metro development history

The Dhaka Transport Coordination Authority (DTCA) created a 20-year strategic transport plan (STP) in 2005 to transform and develop a more integrated transit system for the rapidly growing capital.

The Dhaka Metro MRT system was conceived subsequently to provide more transport options. The project is proposed to be combined with the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) projects.

The Dhaka Urban Transport Network Development Survey (DHUTS 1) funded by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) assessed Dhaka’s STP and selected the first MRT Line-6 from Uttara, a northern suburb to Motijheel, for development. The design work on the project was started in 2014.

Details of MRT Line-6

MRT Line-6 is a 20km-long line extending from Uttara in the north to Motijheel in the south. The line runs parallel to the Turag River in the west of Dhaka and curves as it moves south-east following the path of the Buriganga River.

The line will be a standard gauge track, including a total of 16 elevated stations crossing busy areas such as Pallabhi and Mirpur. The travel time from north to south Dhaka will be approximately 35 minutes.

Construction of the line has been divided into eight packages.

Rolling stock and infrastructure details for MRT Line-6

The MRT Line-6 will feature 24 six-car train sets made of lightweight and highly durable stainless-steel. The commuter cars will measure 19.8m long, 2.95m wide, and 4.1m high. The maximum speed of the train is expected to be 100km/h.

CCTV cameras will be deployed inside and outside of the commuter cars to ensure the safety of passengers. Additionally, each car will have two air-conditioning units to beat the high temperatures and humidity in Dhaka. Each car will have four doors on each side.

The line-6 infrastructure includes automatic fare collection systems, platform screen doors, staircases, elevators, and escalators. The length of each platform is expected to be approximately 180m.

Financing for MRT Line-6

JICA is providing approximately 75% or $2.13bn of the estimated investment of Line-6, while the Government of Bangladesh is funding the remaining 25%, which amounts to $690m. Other forms of grants for training and preparing studies are also being provided by JICA.

MRT Line-1 details

MRT Line-1 will be 30.6km long, including an 18.8km underground section and an 11.8km viaduct section that will cover 19 stations. The line comprises two routes, the Airport Line and the Purbachal Line.

“The public transport system will aid in the economic and social development of the greater Dhaka area.”

The Airport line will connect the Kamalapur station with the Dhaka International Airport. It will include 12 stations, running through an underground tunnel starting from Kamalapur, Rampura DIT, and Pragati Sharani Road, crossing the Kuril flyover, and continuing under the New Airport Road to the airport. The expected travel time in the route is 24 minutes and 40 seconds.

The Airport Line will branch out to the Purbachal Line at the Notun Bazar station, which will include seven stations. It will include underground and elevated sections and run from Kamalapur to Purbachal New Town, the biggest planned township in the country. The expected travel time in the route is 36 minutes and ten seconds.

Active	"The work of Dhaka Elevated Expressway Project, a fast-track initiative of the government, is going at a slow pace for delay in land acquisition and other problems SYED ZAKIR HOSSAIN

Land acquisition, transfer and construction of utility infrastructure major impediments

Taking too much time in land acquisition and utility transfer is slowing down the progress of Dhaka Elevated Expressway Project meant to ease the pressure of traffic through the capital.

As per the agreement, the government is responsible for handing over ready land to Italian Thai Development Public Company Limited (ITDPCL), which is implementing the project.

""The first phase work has already taken six years due to delay in land acquisition. So, I don't know how much time it will take for handing over land to the investor for the second and the third phases,"" Professor Shamsul Hoque of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology vents his disappointment.

The first phase involves the stretch from Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport to Banani Rail Station, the second phase from Banani Rail Station to Moghbazar Rail Crossing and the third phase from Moghbazar Rail Crossing to Kutubkhali linking with Dhaka-Chittagong Highway.

The project's main work began on October 1, 2018 formally. The first phase will be completed by November this year, the second phase by December 2020 and the third (final) phase is scheduled to be completed by March 2022.

""Huge challenges are involved in land acquisition, and transfer and construction of utility infrastructure, which is delaying project implementation,"" mentions Professor Hoque, engaged with the project as a technical expert.

Professor Jamilur Reza Choudhury, who is heading the panel of experts of the country's large infrastructure projects including the DEEP, finds non-availability of funds and lack of cooperation of railway authorities in setting up alignment from Kamalapur Rail Station towards Kutubkhali as the main impediments.

Besides, he says, the project is suffering from various other problems such as financial problem of the investor and multiple changes in the expressway route alignments.

In the development field, there is a term 'CP' (conditions precedence), which means discharge of responsibilities of all stakeholders in implementing development works of a country. ""It is poor here (in Bangladesh),"" Dr Jamilur tells Dhaka Tribune.

The country's eminent civil engineer, however, goes on to say that project has no flaws in its design but the only issue with it is that it is taking too long.

Under PPP (Public Private Partnership) initiative, the government awarded the DEEP construction to ITDPCL on December 15, 2013.

As of August 2019, physical progress includes construction of 1,333 working pile driving, 306 pile cap, 86 cross beam, column 196 (full) and 134 (partly), 186 eye-guarder casting and 147 span-eye guarders.

The total length of DEEP is 46.73km, including 19.73km mainline.

Meanwhile, the ITDPCL has partnered with two Chinese companies — China Shandong International Economic & Technical Co-Operation Group Ltd (also known as Shandong Hi-Speed Group) and SINOHYDRO (S) PTE, a Chinese state-owned hydropower engineering and construction company.

They also signed loan agreement with China EXIM Bank and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) for financing.

According to loan agreements, China EXIM Bank will finance $461 million or BDT3,918 crore while ICBC will provide $400 million or BDT3,400 crore to implement the project.

Project Director AHMS Aktar informs that delegations of two Chinese banks visited the project site on June 11 this year and held a meeting with officials of the bridge division following signing of the tripartite loan agreement among lenders, investors and the government of Bangladesh.

He hopes that the project work will gain momentum following release of funds from the two Chinese banks.

""Members of delegations of the two Chinese banks have told me that they will release funds soon. We are expecting it by next month,"" he told Dhaka Tribune.

According to him, the partners are providing equity support to ITDPCL while the government has also disbursed its committed funds, called viability gap funding (VGF).

ITDPCL representative in Bangladesh, Thai citizen Montchai, says that his company will share 49% of total investment and benefits of the project with its partners — Shandong Hi-Speed Group and SINOHYDRO (S) PTE.

Of the project cost, $11,480,100 will be borne by China Shandong International Economic & Technical Co-Operation Group Ltd/ Shandong Hi-Speed Group and $5,180,000 by SINOHYDRO (S) PTE.

Montchai says both the partners have shared equity investments and worked together to organize loan from China EXIM Bank and ICBC.

The total project cost initially was Tk8,940.18 crore, which later rose to Tk3,653.70 crore including the government's VGF proportion worth Tk2,413.84 crore. The estimated construction period was 3.5 years. Bangladesh Bridge Authority (BBA) is supervising the implementation phase.

During a visit last week, Dhaka Tribune found physical work in progress with construction of pile completed in the stretch from Airport to Banani. Presently, the work of setting up eye-guarder and slabs is going on.

The DEEP will be the first big infrastructure project under PPP initiative based on BOOT (Build, Operate, Own and Transfer) module. The ITDPCL will transfer this infrastructure to the government of Bangladesh after 25 years from the date when the agreement was signed.

The government will not share any cost, which may rise due to price hike of raw materials. It will be borne by ITDPCL.

Meanwhile, the government has spent Tk1,700 crore for land acquisition, Tk995 crore for rehabilitation, Tk300 crore for utility relocation and construction.

Revenue share

The ITDPCL will enjoy revenues from traffic for up to 25 years from the date of agreement signing. It will share revenue with the government if per day traffic exceeds 80,000 (every single vehicular movement is one traffic) counts.

Toll Plan

Initially, the toll plan was Tk100 for car-microbus, Tk200 for big bus, Tk300 for truck for the ride from Airport to Banani, which experts find not viable. Later, a toll of Tk125 was set for car-microbus, Tk250 for bus, and Tk500 for trucks, for the 26-km expressway.

Motorbikes will not be allowed on Dhaka Elevated Expressway. No overloaded truck will also be allowed. Portable way bridge or weighing measurement equipment will be installed for revenue.

A total of 11 toll plazas will be set up on the entire stretch of the expressway. Of them, five will be on the expressway and the rest on the entry and exit points.

The expressway is expected to reduce traffic inside and surrounding areas of Dhaka. The route will connect Airport, Kuril, Banani, Mohakhali, Tejgaon, Moghbazar, Kamalapur, Sayedabad, Jatrabari-Kutubkhali points with Dhaka-Chittagong Highway.

Initially, this project was due to end between 2010 and 2014, which was later extended up to December 2016. Eventually, the deadline was shifted to 2022.

It will take only 20 minutes from Airport to Kutubkhali once the expressway opens to traffic, experts say."	https://www.dhakatribune.com/business/2019/09/10/work-of-dhaka-elevated-expressway-at-a-crawl
Active	"Description

This port in Payra, Bangladesh, is partially constructed and began basic operations in August 2016. According to BMI research, the full port construction project will have 19 separate components, 13 of which will be implemented under foreign direct investment, and six of which will be financed through government-to-government deals. The total cost of the port is estimated to be 11-15 billion USD. In September 2017, the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology won a contract to prepare the master plan and design of the port. The China Harbour Engineering Company and China State Engineering and Construction Company (CSCEC) were awarded contracts worth USD $600 million to develop two of the 19 components. CHEC will construct the main port infrastructure (terminals etc.), and CSECC will be responsible for riparian aspects, the construction of housing, healthcare and education facilities around the port. A coal-based power plant is also being constructed to power the port and port city.

The port is being developed in three stages. Under the Long-Term Plan, by 2023 the port have a 16 meter channel, all terminals would be constructed, and associated facilities - an EEZ, airport, port city, dockyard/shipyard, and eco-tourism facilities - would be in place.

This project is part of the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Economic Corridor, which was initially put forth under China's Belt and Road Initiative. India, which has not signed on to the BRI, has supported and financed the development of Payra Port.

Project data for this page was provided by Fitch Solutions, a Fitch Group company that focuses on country risk and industry research and analysis."	https://reconnectingasia.csis.org/database/projects/payra-deep-sea-port-construction/29017d80-6361-42de-80b8-a279982dc4fc/
Active	"The entrance of the Payra Deep Sea Port, beyond which a concrete road connecting the port with the national highway is currently in progress Mehedi Al Amin/Dhaka Tribune

Although dredging is yet to begin, project authority says work is going on at a steady pace and the port will be functional by 2021. This is the first part of a two-part series exploring one of Bangladesh’s biggest construction endeavours

Initiative of building Bangladesh’s third sea port on 6,500 acres of land at Kalapara in Patuakhali is making steady progress, authotiries say, even though the construction of major components such as terminals and dredging is yet to begin.

The government has already completed the construction of some sections while some others are underway. Completion of those will enable the port to run general import and export activity in a limited range.

To build the Payra Deep-sea Port, authorities have acquired 2,300 acres of land out of 6,500 acres that is necessary. The project is the hope of the locals for employment and development; many locals are already working at the site

In addition, outside of the port area, three large coal-based power plants with 1300MW capacity each are also under construction. The sites for liquefied natural gas (LNG) and oil refinery have been started by the private entrepreneurs.

Since 2013, vehicles have been loading and unloading goods at the site. Currently only ship-to-ship loading and unloading is taking place. Authorities said, in the near future, this port will turn into a deep sea port with 14.5 meter draft at Rabnabad Channel with air port, cargo, coal, LNG terminal, two long jetties.

The Bangladesh government declared this project as one of the “10 Fast Track” projects being implemented by the government. This port will connect the rest of the country by water, road, rail and airway.

Completed components

The Dhaka Tribune has confirmed through a field visit that the Payra Port Authority (PPA) has already completed the construction of a warehouse that has the capacity to hold 100,000 ton goods.

A six storey administrative building is also under construction and mostly done. It has already been opened for official activity as a site office for the port.

Construction of a water purification plant is also complete. The function of this plant is to provide the port and adjacent area with safe drinking water. This three component construction is on 16 acres of land. An 80 meter long and 21 meter wide temporary jetty for service yard has also been set up and construction is going on in full swing.

Housing for the officials and staff of PPA is under construction on 32 acres of land just beside the administrative area. Most of the construction work here is complete as well. Some officials are already living there.

Construction of a four lane port connecting concrete roads with the national highway is currently in progress. Officials of the port are expecting the construction of this road will be completed in June this year. The general activity of the port may start after completion of this four lane road, according to officials.

Rehabilitation of the homeless people due to land acquisition for port construction is also underway. According to PPA, there are six rehabilitation clusters ongoing on 484.11 acres of acquired land, and it will accommodate at least 3,500 affected families. The authorities are expecting the rehabilitation will be complete next year.

What the massive port area will hold

The port area is expected to have the following constructions in the future: oil refinery, oil terminal, LNG import terminal, coal terminal, ro-ro terminal, trade car terminal, 600 meter long general cargo terminal, 400 meter sand and aggregate terminal, 200 meter grain terminal, 2 kilo meter long deep water container terminal, 2.5 kilo meter long container trans-shipment terminal, 44 meter offshore supply base, support craft harbour, fishing harbour, fabrication facility, dry dock, a 1320MW power plant, air port and free trade zone.

Progress of main project

An agreement has been signed between PPA and Netherlands based company Jan De Nul for dredging. By 2021, 75 kilometer long capital and maintenance dredging works is expected to be completed to facilitate up to 10.5 meter drafts of 40000 DWT bulk carriers.

The government has also approved first terminal construction project for Payra Port at a cost of Tk4,000 crore.

Another multipurpose terminal project at the cost of $600 million with the Indian line of credit is also in the process of approval. Consultancy agreement for the port master plan has been signed with Dutch company Royal Haskoning DHV and Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (Buet). A tender for the construction of coal terminal was also opened on Thursday.

Government initiatives

The government is taking initiatives to make a four lane highway from Faridpur to Kuakata, as well as a railway line from Padma Bridge to the Payra Port. Port authority wants the government to make the four lane road and railway line by 2021. That is also the expected completion time of the dredging of Rabnabad Channel and the first terminal.

Locals welcome Payra Port project

People of the locality say they welcome the construction of the port, although they had some hardship due to giving up a massive amount of land for the project.

Abu Sayed, a young man from Hasnapara of Kalapara upazila said: “In spite of losing land I think the port construction initiative is a wise decision for the greater development of the country. Our locality will be developed, we will get jobs here. The port authority is providing various training programs to make us eligible for the jobs.”

Abdul Haque Mridha, an inhabitant of Banati Bazar at Kalapara upazila said: “We are looking forward to our locality being developed. Already the price of land is quite high. Various private companies are working on the project; with that our people are finding work.”

Current port activity

The port is now open and earning revenue by loading and unloading goods. From 2013 to 2018, around 27 vehicles arrived at the port with 5 to 13.50 meter draft. Goods were transported by lighterage. The most transported goods are stone chips, cement clinkers, dredging materials, and plant machinery.

Dredging dilemma

Renowned German scientist HR Kudras in a conference last month said Payra Port would not be viable as a deep-sea port in the long run due to a huge amount of sedimentation.

He said tide from a powerful cyclone like Sidr can fill up the entire channel with silt within two hours. He suggested transferring the project to another more suitable place. Kudras also suggested dredging up to 15 meter of draft at the Rabnabad channel. PPA has not denied his point directly but is taking it into account as a challenge.

‘Port in full swing by 2021’

PPA Chairman Commodore M Jahangir Alam said: “Among the main projects, first terminal, coal power plant and dredging work will start at the middle of this year. By 2021 international ships will be able to come to the terminal directly. Rehabilitation will be completed at the middle or end of next year.

“Payra is a huge project; we cannot do all the work at once. That is why we are synchronizing projects so that we can start the port in full swing by 2021.”

“I hope the four lane highway and railways line from Padma bridge to port area will be completed by the concerned ministry by 2021. These are necessary for the operation of the port” he added.

Member (marine and harbour) of PPA Commodore Md Saidur Rahman said: “Sedimentation is a challenge but I do not totally agree with the German scientist. Dredging will be completed in 34 month. In the first 14 months the actual amount of siltation in the channel will be determined. Three observation posts (monopoles) at sea will be installed and two dredgers will be mobilized to observe tidal levels, current speed and direction, wind speed and direction, mining five dredging test pits and various types of engineering studies.

“Dredging alignment and sedimentation rates will be determined by observing all the above mentioned tasks and the best method for capital and maintenance dredging will be formulated accordingly.“

“For turning the port into a deep-sea port we have plans to dredge up to 14.5 meter in future” he added.

An independent expert gave the opinion that Kudras may not have the correct idea about the project.

Former vice chancellor of Brac University, water and river expert Dr Ainun Nishat said: “We never saw such sedimentation during several powerful cyclones in coastal areas.

Active	"As part of the Trans-Asia Railway Network to boost regional trade, the Asian Development Bank is building a railway corridor through the last remaining tropical hills forest and wildlife sanctuaries along the Bay of Bengal coast in Bangladesh. The railway will eventually extend to Myanmar and establish rail-freight connectivity among India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, and China. One of the future loops will extend to a planned deep-sea port off Bangladesh’s Cox’s Bazar coast.

The bank itself categorized the 1.8 billion USD mega-construction project in ecologically critical areas of Chittagong-Cox’s Bazar region as having the most severe impact on people and the environment. As per ADB’s environmental impact categorisation, the project had an “A” listing in the severity of impact in both the environmental and involuntary resettlement categories. This means that the project will have severe and irreversible impacts. The region is already heavily deforested due to the expansion of industries, power plants, other mega-infrastructure projects, and lately sheltering Rohingya refugees from Myanmar.

Many conservationists, researchers, and officials declined to comment on the project on the record, a pattern familiar in recent years in Bangladesh. Only those senior enough not to fear retaliation were willing to speak. “Global organisations are taking advantage of the absence of democracy and the culture of suppressing critical opinion in Bangladesh. The Asian Development Bank is no exception,” said noted attorney and environmentalist Syeda Rizwana Hasan.

She said that several ADB funded projects have been stalled in Bangladesh in recent years because of lack of participation by local communities and in many cases, people actively opposed such projects. This project had been in the pipeline for many years before the financier started moving quickly in 2013. “Everything is done very quietly and the Bank is talking only with the Bangladesh Railway and related authorities,” said Hasan.

Threatening aquatic ecosystems

Authorities expect to complete the stretch between Dohazari and Cox’s Bazar within the next three years. Walking along the tracks being laid, one could see big bridges over rivers like the Sangu under construction, and many smaller streams filled with earth. Many streams are now allowed to barely run through pipes much narrower than their original courses. Hillsides are being cut and culverts are being built.

Ishtiaq Uddin Ahmed, a former Chief Conservator of Forests and earlier the representative of Bangladesh to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, said that every stream in the hill forest region is home to a highly biodiverse ecosystem. “This whole area is either protected forests or wildlife sanctuaries. It is safe to assume that such construction of structures will do serious damage to both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. There should be a large-scale biological survey before taking up such mega-construction projects.”

Yunus Ali, another recently retired Chief Conservator of Forests, pointed out that these streams are the main sources of water for drinking, domestic use and irrigation for local communities. “Cox’s Bazar and Chittagong regions have the highest dependency on surface water irrigation,” said Ali.

Cutting through elephant corridors

Parallel to the national highway connecting the eastern regions, the rail line passes through three protected areas – the Chunati Wildlife Sanctuary, the Fasiakhali Wildlife Sanctuary and the Medhakatchapia National Park. “The major portion of evergreen and semi-evergreen tropical forests of Bangladesh is located in this region where dominant species are dipterocarps and associated flora and fauna; there are many unique wildlife species here,” said Ishtiaq Uddin Ahmed.

According to him not only the under-construction railway, but the larger coastal development schemes in the Chittagong-Cox’s Bazar region will pose a huge threat to forests if business goes on as usual. “You have a lot of activities going on here that are directly related to regional connectivity for trade. A large number of coal-based power plants, LPG terminals and ports; a lot of disturbance is going on in this sensitive ecosystem.”

“This is the feeding and foraging area of wild elephants, and god forbid there will be sad accidents, big mishaps when elephants will be run over by trains,” he said. There have been such elephant deaths within ostensibly protected forests in neighbouring India.

The EIA report by Bangladesh Railway has recommended building “possibly up to five elephant crossing structures”, namely “overpasses”, at the “active elephant crossing points”. Its EIA report says USD 3 million has been allocated to build each overpass.

Ahmed pointed out that wild elephants do not confine themselves in legally protected areas. Elephants in this region are already in crisis due to the loss of habitat and lack of food due to deforestation. “Deforestation is no longer limited to economic expansion; due to the recent surge of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, the deforestation crisis is turning more severe and both the people and elephants are already suffering from conflict,” he said. “Whatever is needed, elevating the railway and letting the elephants pass through normally or taking the rail line underground, should be done. But at least the natural state of migratory corridors of the wild elephants should not be altered.”

Railroading consent

Asian Development Bank acknowledges the overall ecological risks, as its own report shows. The same goes for Bangladesh Railway. Still, the project goes on.

Displacing people

The railway will displace over 2,000 families, more than half of them categorised as vulnerable. Local NGOs fear that many families will not receive any compensation because they do not have legal titles to the land they till for their livelihoods. Many families have lived for generations on the outskirts of protected forests following customary land rights that may not be legally acknowledged.

“Local people were informed one day ahead of the consultation through the local body representative, UNO and local newspaper,” said the Bangladesh Railway in its EIA report. Observers allege that such EIAs, consultations and mitigation plans are not enough, and in this case is a “farce”.

Pavel Partha said, “The Asian Development Bank has the finest guidelines accepted by many in the world. Especially their guidelines about Environmental Impact Assessment are taken very seriously and widely used by many. But there are serious questions here about the process of doing assessments, about how they are collecting data from the field and how their guidelines are being implemented.”

Ignoring UN principles

Partha added that the region is home to many indigenous people who were not consulted before the construction, thus violating UN principles of free prior and informed consent by indigenous communities to any such projects. “We have important farmlands, water streams, waterfalls, rivers, and rich hill forest here. Why do we need such a mega-construction project in such a highly bio-diverse and ecologically sensitive region?” he asked. Partha thinks that neither the ADB nor the Bangladesh Railway is prepared to mitigate the damages that will be done here.

Restoration demanded

Syeda Rizwana Hasan said that a railway is not an indicator of development. “If that was the case, the British already made us so-called developed, they set up extensive rail lines long ago. You can’t sustain development by destroying the ecological balance.” The Asian Development Bank and Bangladesh Railway should have conducted nationwide consultations before finalising such a project, she said.

Hasan said that the kind of mitigation measures recommended by ADB and Bangladesh Railway are just “greenwashing” attempts. They will not be enough to offset the actual harm to the ecosystems or to the people forcibly removed from their land. “As democratic spaces are shrinking in Bangladesh, scope for expressing a dissenting opinion is shrinking. As a result, opportunities for agencies like Asian Development Bank to greenwash is increasing.”

Some former forest department officials are demanding the allocation of more resources to mitigate ecological damages and restore forest and aquatic ecosystems already lost due to the railway construction project.

Bangladesh should not accept any investment that is “ecologically reckless”, said Ali. “We, of course, should welcome foreign investments and loans. But if you look into such practices in many other countries, they have a lower growth rate than us, but they don’t accept such reckless investment.”

He said the impacts will not be reversible in most cases. “If you destroy a hill, and expect to retain same old ecosystem services, that’s very impractical.”

Ahmed said, “Asian Development Bank is a big agency, they work in a coordinated way with other multinational donor agencies. So, I think they can encourage other donor agencies to take up ecological restoration in this region. If habitat restoration goes hand in hand with railway construction, then hopefully it will be possible to strike a balance.”

Dhaka Mass Transit Company Limited (DMTCL), a government-owned company implementing the project, has completed a topography survey and selected an alignment for the 1.16km line under the same project.

“There is a problem here as we will not be able to build the rail lines over the street … Apart from some makeshift structures on the alignment, there are 31 permanent structures [buildings], the land of which we have to acquire,” said MAN Siddique, managing director of DMTCL.

“We are now talking to them [the building owners] under social survey programme,” he said at his office yesterday.

Contacted, Railways Minister Nurul Islam Sujan said both the railways and metro rail are for the people.

“We have a plan to turn the Kamalapur Railway Station into a multi-modal hub, and the extension work [of MRT Line-6] has to be done in coordination with our plan,” he told The Daily Star yesterday.

The construction work of MRT Line-6, the country’s first metro rail project, has made 38.35 percent progress as of November, and the MRT Line-6 is expected to open on December 16, 2021, when the country will be celebrating the golden jubilee of independence.

Once completed, the 20.10km metro rail service with 16 stations will be capable of carrying 60,000 passengers an hour, reducing travel time from Uttara to Motijheel from at least two hours to less than an hour. After the extension work, the total length of the rail route would be 21.26km with 17 stations.

MAN Siddique, also a former secretary of Road Transport and Highways Division, said people coming from outside Dhaka face difficulties getting vehicles at Kamalapur Railway Station.

“Considering this, the prime minister instructed us to extend the route up to Kamalapur …,” he said.

He said the existing street from Motijheel to Kamalapur was not viable for the metro rail lines. So, they selected an alignment where most of the land is owned by Bangladesh Railway and Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation.

He added that as per the new acquire policy, owners of the 31 pieces of land would be given three-time higher price than the existing price of the land and they would get prices of their buildings at current market rate. They would get some other benefits too, he added.

Replying to a query, the DMTCL MD said as per the plan, the work of MRT Line-6 would be completed by December 2021, around three years before the stipulated time, resulting in the reduction of construction cost.

“We are hopeful that we will be able to complete the extension work with the money we can save by implementing the project before the stipulated time.”

He, however, could not say when the construction of the extension work would start.

Asked whether Bangladesh Railway had any reservation over the use of its land,

MAN Siddique said Kamalapur Station is an “iconic structure”, and the BR wanted that the station of metro rail to be built at a place that does not obstruct the view of the structure.

“We want to deal with this issue with a holistic approach, not from a single MRT Line-6 perspective,” he said, adding that apart from the MRT Line-6 station, underground stations of MRT Line-1, -2 and-4 would also be built linking Kamalapur Railway Station.

Transport expert Prof Mizanur Rahman also welcomed the initiative, saying that more people would be benefited by the step.

He said all major inter-district bus terminals and Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport have to be connected to other metro rail lines so that people coming from outside Dhaka could avail the rail service.

Prof Mizanur, also the director of Accident Research Institute (ARI) at Buet, however, said the government should not wait for completing the extension work; it should rather open MRT Line-6 within the deadline for reducing people’s suffering.

He added that the extension would not hamper the plan already been taken regarding the country’s largest railway station -- Kamalapur.

The government aims to build five metro lines -- an elevated, an underground, and three elevated and underground -- in the capital and its adjacent areas by 2030 mainly to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution."	https://www.thedailystar.net/backpage/news/metro-line-6-link-kamalapur-1836388
Active	"Description

The Karnaphuli River Tunnel in the port of Chittagong, Bangladesh is a proposed 3.4 kilometer-long, 10 meter-wide tunnel under the river. The project includes approximately 6 kilometers of connecting roads, and will connect the port of Chittagong to the industrial area of the city to relieve pressure on the three existing bridges. Sedimentation issues precluded the possibility of building an additional bridge. The tunnel is expected to be completed in 2021, and will be the first of its kind in Bangladesh.

The tunnel is expected to improve the Dhaka-Chittagong-Cox's Bazar highway network and will connect to the Asian Highway Network. The China Communications Constructions Company will do much of the construction, and Chinese President Xi Jinping attended the inauguration of the project in 2016.

In June 2015, the Bangladeshi Ministry of Road Transport and Bridges signed an agreement with CCCC to build the tunnel, in November 2015 the ECNEC approved the project, in May 2017 COWI, a Danish company, was appointed to provide the design and construction management, and construction started in August 2017. This project is part of One Belt One Road Initiative.

Bangladesh is set to start tunnel excavation work for the $1.173bn Karnaphuli underwater expressway.

Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will officially launch tunnel boring work under the Karnaphuli River on 24 February.

The four-lane tunnel will have a total length of around 3.43km with an approach road of 5.63km.

Multilane Road Tunnel under River Karnaphuli project director Harunur Rashid Chowdhury told the Dhaka Tribune: “Around 32% work of the mammoth project, which is first of its kind in Bangladesh, has already been completed.”

For the project, a tunnel boring machine (TBM) acquired from China has been deployed at the construction site. This machine is being used as it can dig through soil, sand and even rock layers.



“A new city is expected to be developed in the southern part of Chittagong.”

The project will link Chittagong city to the other side of Karnaphuli River. In addition, the tunnel will indirectly connect to other parts of the country through the Dhaka-Chattogram-Cox’s Bazar national highway network.

Once operational, the tunnel is expected to boost economic activities, trade and commerce and support garments manufacturers in the region.

The project is also expected to improve the capacity of the Chittagong Port Authority.

Chittagong Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Mahbubul Alam told the publication: “A new city is expected to be developed in the southern part of Chittagong. More and more industrial units will be set up in the KEPZ and at the exclusive Chinese economic zone in Anwara Upazila, and huge employment opportunities will be created.”

A contract for building the tunnel has been awarded to the China Communication Construction Company. Work on the project started in December 2017 and is scheduled to conclude by 2022."	https://www.roadtraffic-technology.com/news/karnaphuli-underwater-expressway-tunnel/
Active	"The Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka, Bangladesh, is being expanded in order to address the continued increase in domestic and international passengers and cargo passing through the facility.

The airport is anticipated to witness passenger traffic of approximately 12 million by August 2022 and up to 22 million by 2035.

The ground-breaking ceremony of the third passenger terminal building and other infrastructure was held in December 2019. Being executed by Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) and the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism, the expansion is scheduled for completion in 2022.

It is set to more than double the airport’s annual passenger handling capacity from the current eight million to approximately 20 million, and the cargo capacity from 200,000t to 500,000t.

It is also expected to improve air transportation, as well as economic and social development in Bangladesh.

Shahjalal airport expansion details

The expansion includes the construction of the third passenger terminal building known as Terminal 3, as well as a 5,900m² VVIP complex, 41,200m² cargo building and multi-level car parking building with tunnel.

The new international passenger terminal building will have a floor area of roughly 226,000m².

Additionally, the project will see the construction of several exit and connecting taxiways, a parking apron in Terminal 3, new roads to connect the terminal with the airport road and a drainage system.

Various water treatment, power supply, rescue and fire-fighting facilities will also be built as part of the development.

A feasibility study is currently underway for the construction of a second runway parallel to the main runway.

Construction and financing for the Hazrat Shahjalal airport expansion

A feasibility study for the Hazrat Shahjalal airport expansion project was conducted between 2014 and 2015.

The project was approved by the Government of People’s Republic of Bangladesh in May 2015. The total cost of the expansion is estimated to be ¥192bn ($1.76bn).

The Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh signed an agreement with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) in June 2017 to provide an Official Development Assistance (ODA) loan of up to ¥76.83bn ($689m) for the expansion.

Contractors involved in the Bangladesh airport expansion

“The ground-breaking ceremony of the third passenger terminal building and other infrastructure was held in December 2019.”

CAAB awarded a five-year contract worth ¥4.6bn ($42.1m) to a consortium led by Japanese engineering and consulting company Nippon Koei for the project in August 2017.

The consortium comprises Singapore-based CPG Consultants, Bangladesh-based Development Design Consultants, and Japanese engineering consulting firm Oriental Consultant Global.

Yooshin Engineering, CPG Corporation, and Development Design Consultants took part in the feasibility study of the project.

Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport history and existing facilities

Situated on an 802ha site in Kurmitola, north of the capital Dhaka, Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport began operations in 1980.

The airport has one domestic terminal and two international terminals with a maximum capacity of eight million passengers a year.

The existing terminals will not able to accommodate the growing number of passengers due to capacity constraints.

In addition, Hazrat Shahjalal International’s existing cargo facility is facing flaws regarding its safety and security systems and is also regarded as insufficient to accommodate the growing cargo volumes.

The site’s 3,200m-long main runway was upgraded to asphalt surface in 2013.

The airport also features a multi-storey car parking area and a VIP terminal."	https://www.airport-technology.com/projects/hazrat-shahjalal-international-airport-expansion-dhaka/
Cancelled	"The Vietnamese government has rejected proposals for the 135-MW Dong Nai 6 and 106-MW Dong Nai 6A hydropower projects, citing the results of a recent environmental impact report.

The study, submitted recently to Deputy Prime Minister Hoang Trung Hai, said the hydroelectric plants would destroy more than 325 hectares of forests — 128 of which would include portions of the Cat Tien National Park near Ho Chi Minh City.

The projects would affect the Bau Sau wetlands located inside the park, the report said, violating terms of the Ramsar Convention’s Laws of Biodiversity and Heritage.

The Ramsar Convention is an agreement between 165 member governments dictating the sustainable use of wetlands, and violations by the plants’ developer, Dub Long Gia Lai Group, could cause the national park to lose its UNESCO world heritage recognition.

Cat Tien has been recognized by UNESCO as a “world biosphere reserve” for the 1,700 species of rare plants and 700 species of animals and birds, the organization noted.

Dong Nai 6 and 6A would have been constructed on Vietnam’s Dong Nai River, which is already home to the 180-MW Dong Nai 3, 340-MW Dong Nai 4, 154-MW Dong Nai 5 hydropower projects.

Cancelled	"Official: Government stands firm on cancelling inefficient hydropower projects

The government would continue to tighten control over the hydropower industry, cancelling any inefficient projects, said Deputy Prime Minister Hoang Trung Hai.

Deputy PM Hoang Trung Hai criticises irresponsible hydropower investors



Deputy Prime Minister, Hoang Trung Hai, reaffirmed this intention during a recent interview where he answered questions about the negative impacts of several hydropower dams that recently added to flooding in the country.

Public concerns have been raised over the fact that several hydropower dams worsened flooding caused by the recent typhoons that have hit Vietnam. What are your comments about this issue?

The government has worked out clear policies on hydropower and the country will continue to develop hydroelectricity because of its role in securing the our energy supply. Development of hydropower dams are expected to help store water for industrial and agricultural uses and services as well as those for daily life.

However, many have said that the designers of several hydropower projects are paying too much attention to making profits while controlling flooding during rainy seasons or helping with water shortages during the dry season, have not received enough focus. Some still complain of a lack of coordination between hydropower dams, causing unexpected consequences. What do you think about this?

What I mentioned before just sketched out some of the advantages of hydropower and irrigation dams. The public is concerned with the disadvantages. It’s important to minimise such shortcomings to sustainably develop hydroelectricity.

To this end, supervision is of great importance. The government recently conducted an inspection of all hydropower facilities and irrigation dams nationwide in order to streamline hydropower projects and avoid unplanned events, increase investment efficiency and increase the responsibility of investors.

In order to ensure that hydropower development does not disrupt people’s lives the government has issued operation processes of hydropower dams to better control hydropower projects. The processes would be continuously adjusted to ensure more suitable operations.

In fact, several hydropower and irrigation dams have caused serious flood but it seems that no one has been held accountable, right?

All cases of dam breakdowns and illegally discharging water, which caused floods have been dealt with. However, their violations are not subject to criminal fines. People often think that those whose wrongdoings cause serious consequences must be jailed, but investigative agencies should make the decisions. Many hydropower investors have had to make compensations.

After the recent inspection, the government decided to cancel hundreds of hydropower dams, proving its determination on this issue.

Even though over 400 hydropower projects have been cancelled, do we have a safe situation with hundreds of other projects are still under construction or are planned for construction?

Scrutiny would continue and any and any inefficient projects would continue to be removed. The government recently cancelled six large hydropower projects as well as 418 small and medium-sized ones that are inefficient and have caused serious social and environmental impacts. Two major hydropower projects of Dong Nai 6 and Dong Nai 6A which drew much of public concerns were cancelled. Hundreds of other hydropower projects have been removed from planning as well."	http://dtinews.vn/en/news/018/31812/official--government-stands-firm-on-cancelling-inefficient-hydropower-projects.html
Cancelled	"Nearly half of the small-scale hydropower projects included in the National Master Plan for Power Development until 2020 have been cancelled.



The information was made known by the National Assembly's Committee for Science, Technology and Environment in a recent report.



The Committee, which supervises implementation of policies and laws on hydropower development, said that by May at least 51,000 hectares of forested land had been used for construction of hydropower projects across the country.



However, only 1,061 hectares, or 2.08 percent of that land has been planted with new trees.



The master plan for power development included 1,108 small-scale hydropower projects.



Most of the rejected projects offered lower profits and were not able to attract attention from investors, according to the report.



NA deputy Truong Van Vo proposed that the Government withdraw the planned hydropower projects 6 and 6A in southern Dong Nai province from the national master plan.



In reply to this proposal, Minister of Industry and Trade Vu Huy Hoang said that the two projects had not been approved by the Government.



He added that the investors of these projects had sent reports on these projects’ environmental impact to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, and only with approval from the ministry could the projects proceed.



""If these projects have a great impact on the environment, we will then ask relevant authorities to stop them,"" Hoang was quoted by Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper as saying.



By 2020, the total output of Vietnam's power plants will amount to 75,000 MW, including 48 percent from thermal power plants and 25.5 percent from hydro-power plants, according to the National Master Plan for Power Development until 2020 with a vision to 2030.-VNA"	https://en.vietnamplus.vn/smallscale-power-projects-cancelled/45359.vnp

Cancelled	"SARAJEVO (Reuters) - Montenegro has scrapped plans to add a 254 megawatt (MW) unit at the Pljevlja coal-fired power plant, becoming the first Western Balkan nation to take tougher stance on air pollution from coal, a government official said on Thursday.

Montenegro, like other Balkan countries, faces an acute need for new power sources after decades of under-investment. The new unit was a huge project for the small Adriatic nation and would have accounted for about 8% of its national output.

Ljubo Knezevic, energy advisor to Montenegro’s prime minister, said the move came after a number of changes in European regulations on industrial emissions, as well as the formal attitude of international financial institutions towards projects of this type.

“It was concluded that it is no longer possible to realize the project on commercially justifiable principles, respecting the desired environmental standards,” Knezevic told Reuters.

The government would instead overhaul the existing 210 MW ageing unit at Pljevlja to avoid its closure, boost output and trim greenhouse gas emissions in line with the EU standards, he added.

The EU candidate country also aims to add new wind and solar capacity to help meet the bloc’s renewable energy targets and cut greenhouse gas emissions.

Knezevic said significant investment was already underway for the rehabilitation of two large environmental black spots in Pljevlja, one of which relates to the reclamation of the ash and slag landfill created by operation of the power plant.

Lignite, the most polluting coal, is widely available in the Western Balkans, providing a cheap energy resource and the major source of energy for Kosovo, Serbia, Bosnia, Macedonia and Montenegro.

In 2016, the region’s 16 Communist-era plants with 8 (GW) capacity emitted the same amount of sulphur dioxide as 250 coal-fired plants with 30 times more capacity in the rest of the EU, environmentalist groups said in a recent report.

The region plans to add 2.7 GW of new coal plant capacity in the next decade, mainly financed by Chinese banks."	https://www.reuters.com/article/us-montenegro-coal-pljevlja/montenegro-scraps-plan-for-new-coal-power-plant-on-environment-worries-idUSKBN1W425C

“The government upgraded the Bangladesh Railway Master Plan on January 29, 2018, under a technical assistance project for Bangladesh Railway SASEC Rail Connectivity Investment Activities,” he said.

In reply to another query, the minister said the government had a plan to implement 230 projects at a cost of Taka 5,53,662 crore by 2045.

Sujan said as per the Bangladesh Railway Master Plan, the government would implement all the projects in six phases starting from July 2016 to June 2045.

Among other things under the master plan, the government will construct a Dhaka-Chattagram via Cumilla/Laksam high-speed railway line, a subway on Dhaka-Tongi section and railway line from Dhaka to Paturia via Manikganj.

The minister also said the government would build the Sylhet Railway Station as a modern and international standard one.

“At the talk, the agreement was reached on the total cancellation of Myitsone Dam project and the formation of the nationwide committee by calling the nationwide conference,” said Dr. Nyo Nyo Thin, the founder of Yangon Watch.

Most of those who attend the talk have a common view that the total cancellation of dam project is the best for the future of our citizens. The nationwide committee will emerge through the nationwide conference. After that, we will organize various forms of campaigns nationwide, she added.

“Recent days, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi’s words show a sign of resuming the suspended Myitsone dam project. So we are worrying. I think the government will resume the project. The public are totally against the project. Political activists decided to call a meeting,” she continued.

In a public meeting in Pyay, Bagon Region on March 14, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi said the public should think broadly about the large-scale projects including the Myitson project. They should view these projects from political, economic, social and environmental conservation points of view. It will be wrong if they will view them from the single point of view. Economy and politics are interrelated. We need to keep our promise for the country’s dignity and maintain the trust of the international community.

Construction of the Karnaphuli tunnel under the Karnaphuli river has spurred industrialisation in Anowara and Karnaphuli upazilas of Chattogram.

Industrialisation includes a Chinese economic zone and clothing factories.

The Chinese Economic and Industrial Zone – being built on 781 acres of land in Anowara on the south bank of the river – will create some two lakh jobs.

Its officials said $270 million would be spent for road construction and utilities inside the zone.

They said 15 foreign companies have already expressed interest in investing there.

The Korean Export Processing Zone is partially operating on the other side of the river at present.

Many Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) members have set up factories in the two upazilas, including Belami Textiles, ATP International Ltd, Harrods Garments, GSL Export and Benchmark Apparels.

BGMEA Vice-president AM Chowdhury Selim said many organisations had invested in Karnaphuli and Anowara before construction of the tunnel began and that would increase now.

""There will be more investments here compared to other places. Also, the pressure on Chattogram city will ease as communication between it and the southern areas will improve.""

Anowara and Karnaphuli are on the south bank of the Karnaphuli river while Chattogram city is to the north.

Mohammad Yeassin, director general (attached division office, Chattogram) of the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority, said, ""As Chattogram port and Shah Amanat International Airport are near Karnaphuli and Anowara, there might be investments outside the economic zone too. We call on the foreign and joint venture investors to invest in the Chinese and Mirsarai economic zones.""

Construction of the 3.4km tunnel is going on in full swing. Harunur Rashid, director of the project, said 51 percent of construction had been completed.

The tunnel will link Chattogram city with villages in Anowara and Karnaphuli. It will also elevate upazila sadars to towns.

By building the tunnel, the development model – One City, Two Towns – will be implemented.

Mahabubul Alam, president of Chattogram Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said, ""The tunnel will make the journey from Mirsarai to Cox's Bazar easier. It will boost industrialisation and create employments in the region.""

""The tunnel will help implement the plan to make Chattogram a commercial hub.""

Abdul Hannan, a resident of Karnaphuli, said different types of industries were being set up in his upazila centring the tunnel's construction.

""As a result, land price in the area increased to Tk20 lakh per gonda (0.02 acres) from Tk8 lakh.""

Part of a long-term plan

The Karnaphuli tunnel is part of the mega development plan of the port city.

A 17km seaside ring road from Sagorika near the tunnel has already been constructed while the approach road from Patenga to the tunnel is under construction.

Also, a marine drive from Mirsarai to Cox's Bazar is being constructed.

According to the project's feasibility study, 63 lakh vehicles will use the tunnel in the first year of its opening.

The road that will go to Cox's Bazar through the tunnel will ultimately be extended to China's Kunming city through Myanmar.

Moreover, the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council on February 18 approved a project to elevate the Karnaphuli tunnel link road – which is under construction – to four lanes.

The project's allocation is Tk407.8 crore and it will include Anowara upazila link road (Shikalbaha-Anowara road).

It will be implemented with the government's own finance.

How the tunnel will be built

The tunnel will start from the Bangladesh Naval Academy point and will end in the mid-point of Karnaphuli Fertiliser Company and Chattogram Urea Fertiliser Limited.

It will be 18-31 metres deep under the riverbed.

Two tubes will be built that the vehicles will use to enter and exit the port city."	https://tbsnews.net/bangladesh/infrastructure/karnaphuli-tunnel-construction-brings-industrialisation-51715
Cancelled	"MEXICO CITY, May 21 (Reuters) - The Chinese company at the helm of a consortium that won a $3.75 billion high-speed rail contract last year which was later revoked will be compensated almost 20 million pesos ($1.31 million), a transport ministry official said on Thursday.

The contract, for which the consortium led by China Railway Construction Corp Ltd (CRCC) was the only bidder, was abruptly revoked last fall shortly after it was awarded.

Days later, the government became embroiled in a conflict of interest scandal when it emerged that the wife of President Enrique Pena Nieto was in the process of acquiring a house from one of the Mexican companies in the consortium.

Earlier this year, after the Mexican government relaunched the bid and then canceled it for a second time citing budget cuts, the CRCC gave the SCT a list of costs incurred during the tender and requested compensation.

Yuriria Mascott, a deputy minister at Mexico’s Communications and Transport Ministry, told reporters on Thursday that the government had completed an analysis of CRCC’s costs.

Cancelled	"YANGON, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Myanmar’s government has decided to stop the construction of a 4,000 megawatt coal-fired power plant at the Dawei Special Industrial Zone, a project of Thailand’s Italian-Thai Development Pcl, due to concerns about the environment, a minister said.

“We made the decision to halt this project after reading the concerns about the environmental impact of this plant in local media reports,” Khin Maung Soe, one of Myanmar’s energy ministers, told reporters at a briefing in Yangon on Monday.

The government still has to decide whether to continue with a smaller 400 megawatt plant, he said.

Shares in Italian-Thai, Thailand’s biggest building contractor, initially slipped about 1 percent on Tuesday but were flat at 0400 GMT. The main index was up 0.5 percent. .

Thailand’s Ratchaburi Electricity Generating Holding Pcl had signed an agreement with Italian-Thai in November to build coal-fired power plants with a combined capacity of 4,000 megawatts at Dawei. Its shares were flat.

Under that deal, Ratchaburi would have a 30 percent stake in the project, while Italian-Thai would have the other 70 percent.

International investment in Myanmar has been limited until now because of sanctions imposed by Western countries for human rights abuses under the former military regime.

But a new civilian government has embarked on political and economic reform since last year and, if further steps such as the release of political prisoners are taken, sanctions could be loosened.

Asian countries such as Thailand, China and India are already big investors in the country, especially in its resources sector.

The Dawei port project is scheduled to be implemented in three phases from 2010 to 2019.

Last September Myanmar’s government gave in to public anger and shelved a $3.6 billion Chinese-led dam project, a concession that would have been unthinkable under the previous military government.

The 250 sq km (97 sq mile) Dawei Special Economic Zone, which will include an oil refinery and a petrochemical factory as well as the port, is located in the Tanintharyi region of southern Myanmar on the Indian Ocean, 350 km (217 miles) west of the Thai capital, Bangkok.

Cancelled	"NAIROBI, Feb 23 (Reuters) - A $144 million Kenyan wind power project backed by a joint venture between Macquarie Group and Old Mutual Investment Group has been cancelled due to opposition from local landowners and farmers, developer Kinangop Wind Park said on Tuesday.

Kinangop’s 60.8 megawatt (MW) project in Nyandarua County in central Kenya was due to come online by mid-2015 but progress was hobbled by disputes with residents over compensation for land.

Last year, local farmers also opposed the project, saying they would be forced to sell their land. They also said the turbines could cause health problems, which the developer denied.

Kinangop in a statement seen by Reuters on Tuesday said protests by locals had made it difficult for workers to build the wind farm.

“Due to the consequent material delay, project funds have been depleted and the project can no longer be completed by the shareholders,” it said.

The project had aimed to provide electricity to an estimated 150,000 Kenyan homes by 2018.

Its failure is a setback for the East African nation’s drive to increase its power generation capacity by 5,000 MW in the five years to end-2017.

Kenya’s other wind power projects include the 300 MW Lake Turkana Wind Power site in the north of the country.

Kinangop’s main investor is Africa Infrastructure Investment Fund II which is advised by African Infrastructure Investment Managers, a joint venture between Macquarie and Old Mutual.

The rest of the stake is held by Norway’s investment fund for developing countries, Norfund.

Cancelled	"Nairobi, Kenya - Plans for the development of a coal-fired power plant near a UNESCO world heritage site in Kenya's coastal Lamu region have been scuttled. On Wednesday, an environment tribunal revoked a permit issued for the contentious project.

The National Environment Tribunal (NET) cancelled an environmental impact assessment licence for the Lamu coal project, ruling that ""the circumstances under which it was issued were flawed."" The project is East Africa's first coal-fired power station.

Reading the decision for the tribunal, Justice Mohamed Balala said: ""The EIA licence issued by NEMA [National Environment Management Authority] to the coal project appears to be generic and not specific to the project.""

""Air pollution from coal-fired power plants includes sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and heavy metals, leading to smog, acid rain, toxins in the environment, and numerous respiratory, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular effects,"" Balala read. ""For [NEMA] to have neglected its role in this way was irresponsible.""

Local residents applaud the ruling

Lamu residents and activists who had campaigned against the project, applauded the ruling.

""This is a huge win for the environment, for the people of Kenya and most especially for the people of Lamu,"" said Hussein Khalid, Executive Director for Muslims for Human Rights (MUHURI), a civil society organisation based in the coastal region of Kenya.

""If this project had been permitted to proceed it would have had devastating effects on the environment and the health of people in Lamu,"" Khalid told Al Jazeera.

Residents of Lamu and local leaders have repeatedly warned that the plant would be in the heart of a world heritage tourist hub and threaten the livelihoods and health of local communities.

A 2015, Unesco's World Heritage Committee report stated that: ""There can be no doubt that a project of this scale and scope, in an area as remote and protected as Lamu, cannot help but have profound negative impacts on the heritage.""

Last week, the government condemned critics of the Lamu coal power station, terming them, ""enemies of progress"".

""The plant will boost industrialisation and improve the lives of Kenyans. Industrialisation requires affordable, stable and reliable sources of energy. In the case of Kenya, that source has been identified as coal. It will be the main source to drive industrial growth,"" Government spokesman Col (Rtd) Cyrus Oguna had told a press conference in Nairobi.

Who gets the license now?

The revoked license had been issued to Amu Power Company, a consortium of Kenyan firms Centum Investment Plc and Gulf Energy Ltd as well as international backers.

In February 2015, Amu Power received $1.2bn in financing from the Industrial Commercial Bank of China for the Lamu coal power station.

While activists applaud Wednesday's decision, they plan to remain vigilant. ""This battle is far from over,"" said MUHURI's Khalid. ""We can be sure the interested parties will appeal because it is a project that has got the full backing of government...but we're motivated even as we prepare for the next round."""	https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/kenyan-court-blocks-coal-project-world-heritage-site-190626175050468.html

Cancelled	"In a big blow to the development of North Andhra, four mega projects sanctioned for Visakhapatnam including the 4x1000 MW ultra modern power project by the NTPC at Pudimadaka have been shelved due to various reasons.

Touted as the largest single investment after formation of Sunrise Andhra Pradesh, the NTPC project was dropped on the directive from the Centre to set up the unit at ₹26,828 crore by using domestic coal instead of imported coal as envisaged originally.

“Redesigning the project after acquiring 1,200 acres from the APIIC was found unviable... we have decided not to go ahead with the project,” an NTPC official told The Hindu. The decision is yet to be announced officially though the NTPC withdrew the officials it had posted for the project at the temporary office opened at the Visakhapatnam Special Economic Zone, Atchutapuram. Another project conceived before bifurcation, the IT Investment Region (ITIR), has also met with a premature death due to the Centre’s decision to spike the ITIR Policy.

The TDP government identified 4,074 acres of processing and 5,905 acres of non-processing area for an investment of ₹50,000 crore to ₹60,000 crore.

It commissioned Ernst and Young to conduct a study and submitted a proposal to the Centre to sanction it.

Another setback was the shelving of the LNG terminal at the Gangavaram Port by the Petronet LNG Ltd, a company floated by several profit-making oil companies. The public hearing for the project envisaged with a two-phase 10-million tonne capacity and an investment of ₹9,000 crore was held in 2013.

Poor response

Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu’s promise to develop a better version of the Cyber Tower with a Signature Tower at the sea-facing Rushikonda in 20 acres has fallen flat after naming the American realty firm Janes Long LaSalle (JLL) as project consultant. Poor response to the PPP modelled project from investors led to the permanent closure. An investment of ₹500 crore was mooted for the project under Design, Build, Finance, Operate and Transfer (DBFOT) basis.

The lapse of ₹40 crore led to the removal of plaque to mark the foundation stone laid by Union Minister Nirmala Sitharaman at the Visakhapatnam Special Economic Zone-Duvvada. The tower with 1.09 square ft. area along with 30,000 sft exclusively for disaster data recovery was a long-awaited need. “North Andhra needs several projects from both the Centre and the State. How can the area develop if projects are dropped at this rate,” asked Vizag Development Forum vice-president O.

Cancelled	"SHAH ALAM, Selangor: Cancellation of the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High-Speed Rail (HSR), East Coast Rail Line (ECRL) and trans-Sabah gas pipeline projects can help reduce the government's debt burden by more than RM300 billion, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Monday (Oct 22).

These projects were too costly to be funded by the government, he added.

""In the past, if we were to execute plans, we made sure that we had enough money,"" he said during an appearance on a talk show.

""If we did not have enough money, we determined how much was the debt level (and) how much could be repaid from the return on investment; that's the best way.""

He said that this principle was not practised by the previous government, accusing it of incurring huge debts to carry out mega infrastructure projects without considering the ability to repay them.

The current government only scrapped projects after ascertaining that doing so will not hurt Malaysians, he added.

He cited the ECRL project as an example, where money was borrowed on the condition that a foreign company would be given the contract.

Said the prime minister: “Foreign workers were brought in, while equipment and tools were all made by a foreign country. So what do we get? We’ve got nothing.

“If we were to cancel these projects, the victims are their workers are not ours. So, we cancelled them so that we do not have to pay huge debts.""

Turning to the topic of a third national car project, Dr Mahathir believes it would spark Malaysians’ interest in engineering and manufacturing.

“A car has 4,000 parts. If we want to make a car, we have to know about designing, testing, parts and quality. We have to learn all these,"" he said.

""When a nation controls engineering knowledge, its people will go forward.""



After returning to power, Dr Mahathir has moved to cancel a number of projects, including the Chinese-funded US$20 billion ECRL and the trans-Sabah gas pipeline.



He also announced shortly after Pakatan Harapan's election victory that the HSR project would be scrapped entirely, saying that the rail will not benefit Malaysia.



He later said in July that the project would be deferred instead.

Singapore and Malaysia formally agreed to postpone the construction of the HSR on Sep 5, after the new Malaysian government, through its Minister of Economic Affairs Azmin Ali, made an official request to Singapore to defer the project by three or four years.

Kenya's National Environment Tribunal has cancelled the licence issued to Amu Power Company Ltd for setting up a coal plant, saying it was done unprocedurally.

Anti-coal activists have been pushing for the government to focus on setting up clean energy projects instead of coal.

Organisations, notably Save Lamu, Lamu Youth Alliance and Lamu Marine Forum have been loudly opposed to the proposed Sh200 billion coal power plant.

ILLEGAL LICENCE

The tribunal Wednesday said that the National Environment Management Authority (Nema) issued the environmental impact assessment licence to Amu Power without following the law.

The tribunal faulted the coal project for omitting engineering plans and key facts of the project from public participation as well as failure to take account of the Climate Change Act.

Nema was faulted for granting the coal project a licence that appeared to be generic and not specific to the project.

Katiba Institute had filed the case on behalf of the Save Lamu lobby group. Nema and Amu Power were listed as respondents.

The tribunal, led by Mohamed Balala, said that should Amu Power consider proceeding with the project, it will have to carry out a fresh environmental impact assessment in accordance with the law and comply with all the necessary laws.

Following the ruling, Amu Power CEO Cyrus Kirima said that the firm had taken note of the concerns raised in the ruling and was committed to working with stakeholders to ensure that all matters are addressed.

“Amu Power’s goal is to improve the lives of the communities in Lamu County; employment creation, infrastructure development, upskilling of the youth and the provision of affordable energy generated from coal power.

“A goal which we believe is in the interest of all, both at the county and national level,” Mr Kirima said in a press statement sent to newsrooms.

The project, set to be implemented by Amu Power, a consortium of Gulf Energy and Centum Investment, is to be established at Kwasasi village in Hindi Division, Lamu West.

Some 975 acres of land had already been set aside for the project which is expected to generate 1,050 megawatts of power upon completion.

Cancelled	"The Hà Nội-HCM City High Speed Rail Project is estimated to cost US$58.7 billion. — Photo swissinfo.ch

HÀ NỘI — The Hà Nội-HCM City high speed rail project will benefit the country’s economy, but there are several challenges to implementation of the mega project, including financing, attracting private sector interest and a weak business case.

So said analysts from Fitch Solutions Macro Research in a report released this week on the outlook of the largest infrastructure project in Việt Nam for the next decade.

According to Fitch analysts, the US$58.7 billion project, if approved and implemented, will benefit the development of cities along the route, but securing financing will be the greatest challenge to the project. It is estimated the hefty price tag puts the cost of the project at more than 25 per cent of the country’s nominal GDP in 2017.

According to a proposed plan, the project will use a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model, with 80 per cent of the funds contributed by the Vietnamese government and 20 per cent of the funds provided by the private sector.

Meanwhile, the country has been running a budget deficit averaging 5.4 per cent of GDP over the past five years, and it is very likely funds for the project will have to be raised via the issuance of public debt.

According to the analysts there are several other issues to consider. Việt Nam currently has a self-imposed public debt-to-GDP ceiling of 65 per cent, and current levels of debt have come close to breaching this cap. Unless the government revises the debt-ceiling limit, there will be little headroom for the government to issue debt.

A number of other infrastructure initiatives, such as the expansion of the Hà Nội and HCM City metro systems, are also reliant on public funding, which reduces the Government's financial capacity.

Given these factors, the government is likely to face challenges in project financing which may result in delays, or in the worst case scenario, the cancellation of the project.

“Furthermore, we expect the project to experience cost overruns due to an increase in the price of construction materials and land, as well as delays associated with adverse weather conditions and ineﬃciencies during the project execution phase, and this will result in greater financing diﬃculties for the Government,” the report said.

Besides financing, another potential hurdle is the ability to attract private sector interest, the analysts said, citing the cancellation of the country’s first PPP transport project – the US$750 million Dầu Giây-Phan Thiết Expressway Project – last year due to the withdrawal of potential investors’ bids over financing uncertainties as an example.

“Although the government has continued to push for a number of projects, including the high-speed rail project, to be implemented using the PPP model, they may continue to face challenges in attracting enough bids from the private sector,” the report continued.

A weakening business case will be also a potential challenge for the project as it will have to compete against road and air transport systems that are expected to grow strongly over the next decade.

As such, Fitch concluded that from a cost-benefit perspective, the Government may continue to explore cheaper alternatives, such as the construction of another main line supplementing the existing colonial-era North-South Railway line, which puts the high-speed rail project at risk of suspension. — VNS"	https://vietnamnews.vn/economy/521900/big-challenges-hinder-viet-nams-largest-infrastructure-project.html

Kuala Lumpur. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Tuesday (21/08) that the Chinese-funded $20 billion East Coast Rail Link, or ECRL, project and a natural gas pipeline project in Sabah will be cancelled for now, according to media reports.

Mahathir made the comments while addressing the media in Beijing during his five-day trip to China. He said the projects would be cancelled until such time as Malaysia can afford it.

The Prime Minister's office confirmed the comments Mahathir made to reporters in Beijing.

Mahathir said he relayed the matter to China and they understood the problems faced by Malaysia, the New Straits Times (NST) reported.

""I believe China itself does not want to see Malaysia become a bankrupt country,"" the NST quoted him as saying during a press conference marking the end of his China trip.

Mahathir suspended unpopular Chinese projects in Malaysia after he returned to power in a stunning election victory in May that ended the decade long rule of former premier Najib Razak.

The ECRL project was the centerpiece of China's infrastructure push in Malaysia but work has been suspended pending discussions over pricing and graft accusations.

Mahathir said in a joint press conference with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Monday that he believed China would sympathize with his country's ""internal fiscal problems.""

Prior to his China visit, he had vowed repeatedly to discuss what he called ""unfair"" Chinese infrastructure deals authorized by former premier Najib Razak.

Mahathir also told the press on Tuesday that he did not bring up Low Taek Jho, the Malaysian financier wanted for his role in the multi-billion-dollar scandal at state fund 1MDB, in his dialogue with the Chinese leaders, local reports said.

The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Malaysia believed Low was being harbored in China and that a request to extradite him would be high on Mahathir's agenda during his five-day trip. Reuters could not verify the report.

Cancelled	"BEIJING (Aug 21): East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) and the two pipeline projects will be cancelled for now due to the current government’s fiscal position. The Chinese government understands the rationale for the move, prime minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad told the Malaysian media after he concluding his five-day official visit to China.

Malaysia will have to pay compensation for the cancellation. The compensation for the ECRL project “could be quite substantial”, Dr Mahathir said. The final sum will be negotiated soon.

The prime minister’s latest remark on the three projects of which China’s state-owned enterprises are involved, will end speculation that his official visit might raise hope that the new government would revive the projects that have been served stop work notice.

Also, it may ease concern that the project cancellation might anger the Chinese government, since building infrastructure across Asia to improve connectivity is part of its Belt and Road initiative.

“The projects will not go now, because we don’t need them at the moment. Our priority is reducing our debts, if we are not careful, we could be bankrupt,” Dr Mahathir said — a point that he has made since he being appointed as prime minister for the second time three months ago.

“The Chinese government, they see our point of view. I met three leaders here. No one of them says no. They understand why we don’t need (the projects),” he added.

Dr Mahathir met China’s president Xi Jinping, premier Li Keqiang and chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of China, Li Zhanshu yesterday (Aug 20).

“We must find an exit from the projects at lowest cost possible. We will have to pay compensation. This is our own people’s stupidity; we can’t blame the Chinese for that,” said Dr Mahathir when asked about compensation for cancelling the projects.

“This is stupidity of the negotiation before. There must be exit clauses in all agreements and the exit clauses must be fair for both parties.

“He (Datuk Sri Najib Razak) is the one…I never see a contract (like this before), that money (is) paid before the work (gets) done….What kind of stupidity of this, (you need) to pay on time, without any conditions that work must be done,” Dr Mahathir commented.

The money that has been drawn down from the loans extended to the three projects, is not in proportion to the work in progress. “So, we need (to) find out why the money (was) paid and no work done. All negotiation will be done by our people,” Dr Mahathir said.

“We will recover the money from Najib,” he added, when asked how the government would pay back the sum that has been drawn down.

The three projects, namely ECRL, multi-product pipeline in Malacca and Trans-Sabah Gas pipeline which were undertaken by the Barisan-Nasional government, have been under scrutiny after Pakatan Harapan gained controlled of Putrajaya.

The new government has put a stop work notice to the three projects, after they had discovered that the project costs have bloated to unjustified levels.

Cancelled	"Business Standard:



The findings of a study by the US-based Institute for Energy Economics & Financial Analysis (IEEFA) show India cancelled 464,727 coal-based generation projects planned since 2010. The portfolio of coal-fired projects includes those in varying stages, from conception to grant of permissions. Next to India is the Asian hegemon China which abandoned coal-based projects totaling a capacity of 296,780 Mw. Vietnam ranks next to China with 30,750 Mw of coal-powered projects in the pipeline meeting the same fate followed by Turkey (29204 Mw), US (26873 Mw), Germany (18393 Mw), Russia (18048 Mw) and Poland (16783 Mw).

“Since the start of 2010, through postponements and cancellations, India’s coal plant pipeline has shrunk by 547 GW (or 547,000 Mw). To put that number in perspective, it’s helpful to remember that it amounts to almost three times Germany’s total installed capacity”, Tim Buckley, director of energy finance (Australasia) at IEEFA said in a report.

NTPC Ltd, the country’s largest owner and developer of coal-based plants recently shelved its 4000 Mw Pudimadaka ultra mega power plant (UMPP) project in Andhra Pradesh. IEEFA observed that the decision to cancel the country’s largest planned new coal-fired station is just the latest step in India’s remarkable and ongoing energy transition.

As of now, more than 80,000 Mw of coal-fired capacities are shown as still progressing through approval processes. IEEFA, however, estimates that only 10,000-20,000 Mw of the planned capacity may actually see the light of the day, signifying an effective cancellation of 84 per cent of the country’s 2010 coal pipeline.

Background

The original Shen'ao power station, also known as Shenzhen-Macao power plant, consisted of three coal- and oil-burning units (1 X 75 MW, 1 X 125 MW, 1 X 200 MW). It was commissioned from 1960 to 1966. The units were retired in 2007 and demolished in 2011.[1][2]

Description of Expansion

Project proposed and then shelved

The old Shen'ao Thermal Power Plant was originally planned to be replaced by two 800 MW coal-burning units. The investment is estimated at NT$108.9 billion, with the commercial operation dates for Units 1&2 planned for April 2018 and April 2019. The environmental impact assessment (EIA) was approved in 2006 and preliminary construction began in 2011. The project has faced strong and sustained opposition from local residents.[3][4]

In its 2014 Annual Report, Taipower said the project's application was ""postponed"", with a planned operation date of 2022-2023.[5]

In August 2016 it was reported that the public opposition had suspended development of the plant, but that Taipower planned to amend its feasibility report for the project (now 2 x 600 MW), and have it commissioned by 2025.[6]

Project revived again ... and shelved once more

In 2017 Taipower resubmitted an EIA, which was approved by the Taiwan EPA in March 2018. In response, Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) lawmakers demanded the EPA deputy head step down for his approval, as the New Taipei City Government has declared its intention not to issue any additional coal-use permits.[7]

The decision of the centre-left Democratic Progressive Party central government to approve the project became a central issue in the mayoral election campaign scheduled to be held on November 24. In April 2018 candidates for both the Democratic Progressive Party and the Chinese Nationalist Party publicly opposed the project after the central government refused to undertake a new environmental assessment for the project after it was last approved for construction in 2011. [8] [9]

In July 2018 an administrative appeal was lodged against the proposed project on the grounds that pollution from the project would damage public health. The appeal also argued the proposed coal terminal and breakwaters would cause damage to marine life in a conservation area.[10]

All the while a petition calling for referenda questions on both the proposed plants and new air pollution standards were gathering momentum. By Late August over 482,000 people had signed a petition calling for a referendum on the proposed 1200 MW Shenao power station in New Taipei City’s Rueifang District. The petition had well over the 281,745 signatures required for a referendum to be held. Another referendum petition proposing new air pollution regulations gained 496,444 signatures.[11]

In August 2018, Taiwan’s Minister for Economic Affairs pledged to “negotiate” with residents before going ahead with plans for the plant. According to local media reports, the Cabinet was considering stopping the expansion work altogether, pending approval by Premier Lai Ching-te, after the Presidential Office intervened in the matter due to strong public criticism. However, the Presidential Office denied any interference, saying the Ministry of Economic Affairs is responsible for making a decision based on its authority.[12]

The campaign against the plant stepped up further when a health study undertaken by three academics from Taiwanese universities but commissioned by Greenpeace revealed the likely health toll from the plant. The study estimated 570 people would die prematurely due to increased air pollution in the first 15 years of operation of the proposed 1200 MW Shenao coal plant. The study focussed on the death toll only from heart disease, strokes, lung cancer or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease caused by increased PM 2.5 fine particle air pollution. The study did not estimate the non-fatal health impacts from PM2.5 pollution or illnesses caused by other power plant pollutants. The study, which was The study on the proposed plant by the Taiwan Power Company simulated air quality for just a two-month period while the Greenpeace study modelled the impacts of fine particle air pollution over a year.[13]

In October 2018, the MOEA announced that the plan to expand the plant was cancelled. Premier Lai Ching-te (賴清德) said at a legislative hearing earlier Friday that he agreed with the decision. Activists applauded the decision. The plan had been approved by multiple groups, including Green Citizens' Action Alliance, Greenpeace, Homemakers United Foundation, and Citizen of the Earth Taiwan.[14]

Cancelled	"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia seized more than 1 billion ringgit ($243.5 million) from a bank account of state-owned China Petroleum Pipeline Engineering (CPP) over incomplete pipeline projects, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Monday.

The seizure comes nearly a year after Malaysia suspended two pipeline projects, valued at $2.3 billion, on which CPP was the lead contractor. CPP is a unit of state energy giant China National Petroleum Corp.

“I understand that money for 80% of the pipeline was paid, but the work completed was only 13%,” Mahathir told reporters. “So the government is entitled to get back the money, since the project was canceled.”

His comments followed a report on Saturday from Singapore-based Straits Times, which said that Malaysia had seized the funds from CPP’s account at HSBC Malaysia.

HSBC declined to comment, citing client confidentiality.

In an email sent to Reuters late on Monday, CPP said it understood Malaysia’s Anti-Corruption Council ordered the fund transfer and that it was made without the company’s knowledge.

“CPP is currently speaking to the relevant parties in a bid to obtain and understand the basis of the transfer. Once we have further information, CPP will take the necessary and appropriate actions to protect its rights,” the Chinese company said.

In 2016 CPP won a contract from the government of former prime minister Najib Razak to build a 600km petroleum pipeline along the west coast of peninsular Malaysia and a 662km gas pipeline in Sabah, the Malaysian state on Borneo island.

Both projects were suspended by Mahathir in July last year after he defeated Najib in the 2018 national election.

Mahathir had vowed to renegotiate or cancel what he calls “unfair” Chinese projects authorized by Najib, straining ties with Malaysia’s biggest trading partner.

Malaysia and China this year agreed to resume a multibillion-dollar rail project after shaving off nearly a third of its cost to 44 billion ringgit.

Mahathir on Monday said he was not concerned about a fallout with China for seizing money from a state-owned Chinese firm.

“I don’t see why the Chinese would feel unhappy about it because we are not taking back money for what they have done,” he said.

Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said that both countries should have “friendly consultations” on any problems arising during the project to resolve them in an appropriate way.

China and Malaysia have a strong cooperative relationship, and China is confident this will continue, Geng told a daily news briefing."	https://www.reuters.com/article/us-malaysia-politics-china/malaysia-seized-240-million-from-chinese-company-over-pipeline-project-pm-mahathir-idUSKCN1UA1DU

Cancelled	"FRANKFURT, April 26 (Reuters) - German utility RWE is to cancel future investment in coal-fired power plants, including a large brown coal power plant at Niederaussem near Cologne, to focus on renewables.

The company is planning a major reorganisation later this year under which RWE will take over 10,000 MW of renewable power assets from subsidiary Innogy and rival E.ON , making it the world’s number five renewables company.

“In the future, RWE will focus on electricity generation from renewable energy sources. Consequently, the company will no longer invest in new coal-fired power stations,” it said in a statement on Friday.

RWE had originally started planning for the for the 1,200 megawatts (MW) BoAplus lignite-fired power station at Niederaussem in 2012 to replace older generation units at the site that uses locally mined brown coal with latest coal-burning technology at that time.

But the project was languishing when the wholesale power market slumped between 2012 and 2016 in the wake of the financial crisis and because of overcapacity, which led to major reorganisation in the industry.

Analysts say that global climate goals and the environmental case against carbon emissions from coal burning now make projects such as Niederaussem unrealistic.

RWE’s chief financial officer Markus Krebber last week told Reuters the company would spend billions of euros in coming years on green power, alongside storage technologies and gas-fired power.

But RWE also said coal would still remain part of its power systems during a transition period. The company still operates 10,300 MW of brown coal and 6,500 MW of hard coal fired capacity in its core European market.

Currently some 40 percent of Germany’s power comes from green sources. RWE said as a result coal plants were needed to provide stable backup capacity, although their share in the electricity mix would decline gradually.

The heavy contribution from volatile renewables puts major stress on power grids and can threaten supply security for consumers. Round-the-clock supply from coal-burning plants can help to keep grids stable.

Cancelled	"RWE has cancelled plans for a new coal-fired power plant in Germany and will focus on electricity generation from renewable energy sources instead.

The company said it will no longer invest in new coal-fired power stations, after cancelling the lignite BOAplus project at the company’s site in Niederaussem.

BOAplus was an option to replace existing units with a new, more efficient power plant, RWE said.

“Its implementation was subject to market conditions, which did not allow for the project to be realised in the last years,” it added.

RWE chief executive Rolf Martin Schmitz (pictured) said: “We are aware of our responsibility and continue to drive the energy transition with resolve.

“New coal-fired power stations no longer have a place in our future-oriented strategy. Following the completion of the transaction with Eon, RWE will be one of the world’s leading renewable energy players.”

However, the company added that, given the fact that renewables currently contribute about 40% to the German electricity mix, it is “convinced that existing coal-fired power stations will be needed to provide backup capacity, although their share in the electricity mix will decline gradually”.

RWE said new power stations and storage will be required in order to ensure long-term security of supply for Germany.

“To this end, the company will invest in renewable energies, storage technologies and low-carbon technologies, such as gas-fired power stations, if market conditions allow for it,” the company said."	https://renews.biz/52825/rwe-cancels-new-coal-plans/
Cancelled	"By Shihar Aneez for Reuters:

Sri Lanka will cancel plans for a 500 megawatt Indian-built coal-fired power plant at its strategic eastern port city of Trincomalee and will instead opt for a liquefied natural gas (LNG) power plant, a cabinet minister said late on Tuesday.

Chandima Weerakkody, Sri Lanka’s petroleum minister, said President Maithripala Sirisena told Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi of the decision at a meeting on Saturday during Sirisena’s visit to the island nation’s larger neighbour.

“We do not want to hurt India. So President Sirisena in his visit has offered an LNG plant instead of the coal plant,” Weerakkody told Reuters. “This has been discussed at the highest level and there is consensus.”

Sri Lanka is trying to increase its power generation capacity after a recent blackout that was the worst in 20 years, government officials say.

B.M.S. Batagoda, the energy ministry secretary said the switch to LNG was proposed after ten years of opposition to a coal-fired power plant by the residents of Sampur, a village near Trincomalee, where India has already proposed to build South Asia’s largest petroleum hub.

Area residents and environmental groups have resisted the coal power plant ever since it was originally proposed in 2006 due to worries about land clearance and pollution.

Plans for the $500 million coal power plant project were finalised in 2011, when state-run Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and India’s state-run National Thermal Power Corporation Ltd (NTPC) agreed to form a joint venture for its construction.

and Khaleeq Kiani in Dawn:

A major Chinese firm has bowed out of a Punjab-based 330MW coal-based power project that was scheduled to start electricity production by end-2017.

The $590 million mine-mouth project was a key component of the high profile $46 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) launched last year by President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. A letter of interest (LoI) was issued to develop the project on local coal at Pind Daden Khan in Punjab’s Salt Range.

Sources told Dawn that China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) lost interest in the project because of issues relating to feasibility of producing enough energy for running a 330MW project and a tariff allowed by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) that was lower than its expectations.

The company which is also a key contractor in the $4 billion 969MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project in Azad Jammu & Kashmir had been lobbying for 11.67 to 12.4 cents per unit tariff that was far higher than upfront tariffs for projects on Thar coal and imported coal. Nepra allowed a 30-year levelised tariff of 8.55 cents per unit.

Sami Rafi Siddiqui, spokesman for the Private Power and Infrastructure Board — the one-window organisation for private power projects — confirmed that the project was not moving. He said the PPIB had encashed $300,000 performance guarantee of the project sponsor for its failure to deliver on LoI conditions. He declined to give further details at this stage.

Activists on Friday applauded the government’s decision to scrap plans to expand the coal-fired Shen’ao power plant, which had been met with heavy opposition from environmental groups since it was announced in March.

Hung Shen-han (洪申翰), secretary-general of the Green Citizens’ Action Alliance, hailed the government’s decision as a step in the right direction, saying the project would have had a profoundly negative affect on the environment if the project had been carried out. The government needs to be more decisive in promoting energy transformation instead of resorting to coal or nuclear power, Hung contended.

Chen Chih-chiang (陳志強), head of the Anti-Shen’ao Self-Help Association, said that while he applauded the decision, he will only have peace of mind when he sees the Ministry of Economic Affairs and state-run utility Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) make the announcement official on paper.

Premier Lai Ching-te (賴清德) said at a legislative hearing earlier Friday that he agreed with a decision made by the (MOEA) to shelve the project in New Taipei. The announcement represented a U-turn from March 2018, when Lai’s administration approved an environmental impact assessment (EIA) for the Shen’ao facility and appeared determined to proceed with the project.

The government’s reversal showed on Friday that public opinion and people power can indeed prevail, Hung said.

Cancelled	"Redondo Peninsula (RP) Energy Inc.—an affiliate of both the MVP and Aboitiz groups—has canceled a P46.3-billon order for two coal-fired generators from a South Korean contractor, citing the continued delay of regulatory action on related supply contracts and tariffs.

Doosan Co. Ltd. last week informed the Korea Exchange that its subsidiary, Doosan Heavy Industries and Construction Co. Ltd., received from RP Energy a letter of contract termination on March 13.

Based in Seoul, the Doosan group is engaged in infrastructure support businesses ranging from power generation, desalination and engines as well as consumer and service businesses.

Doosan said in its regulatory filing the contract with RP Energy —valued at 952.3 billion Korean won or about $891 million—was canceled because “the NTP (notice to proceed) for this project was not issued until Dec. 31, 2017, due to delayed tariff approval for the project by the Philippine Energy Regulatory Commission.”

According to the Korean firm, Doosan Heavy and RP Energy were “in negotiations for the resumption of the project” despite the latter having served notice of the contract’s termination.

When asked for comment, RP Energy declined to give any, citing the sensitive nature of ongoing talks with the Doosan group.

First announced in October 2016, the engineering, procurement and construction contract covered two 300-megawatt generators that use CFB (circulating fluidized bed) technology.

RP Energy is a partnership among Meralco, Aboitiz Power Corp., and Taiwan Cogeneration Corp. through their respective subsidiaries Meralco PowerGen Corp., Therma Power Inc. and Taiwan Cogeneration International Corp.

On Feb. 26, Meralco president and chief executive Oscar S. Reyes reiterated that a power supply agreement (PSA) between RP Energy and the distribution giant—covering 225 MW of the Redondo facility’s 300-MW Unit 1 —was submitted for action at the ERC in April 2016.

Reyes said public hearings, a technical working group review and assessment of the PSA, the tariff and other related processes were “essentially completed at the end of April 2017.”

RP Energy has also signed with Aboitiz Energy Solutions Inc. a separate PSA for the Redondo Unit 1’s remaining 75 MW of capacity.

The RP Energy PSAs were among several PSAs that involved Meralco and were still pending with the ERC, which has recently just emerged from paralysis caused by an order from the Office of the Ombudsman for the suspension of four ERC commissioners. The Court of Appeals issued last February a 60-day temporary restraining order against the Ombudsman’s decision.

“Their (PSAs’) approval with urgency is needed, even as the passage of time since their filing in 2016 has already caused significant increases in the (EPC) costs and financing costs of these new power plants,” Reyes said.

“These PSAs are required to be in place by their target commercial operations date to ensure adequate, efficient and reliable power supply and to thereby avert the risk of power outages that will be damaging to the economy, businesses and industries, and households,” he added.

Cancelled	"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany is set to become the first country to drop both nuclear and coal power under a landmark agreement to compensate workers, companies and regional governments as it switches off brown coal-fired plants by 2038.

The government struck a deal worth more than 40 billion euros ($44.7 billion) in the small hours of Thursday morning with the premiers of Germany’s coal-mining regions.

Once the heartland of Germany industry, the coal regions of North-Rhine Westphalia have fallen on hard times as traditional heavy industries have lost sway, while coal regions in the east have yet to fully shrug off the impact of four decades in Communist East Germany.

Designed to ensure Europe’s largest economy meets its 2030 target for cutting greenhouse gas emissions, the exit will be accompanied by heavy investments in renewable energy.

“Germany, one of the strongest and most successful industry nations in the world, is taking huge steps towards leaving the fossil fuel era,” Finance Minister Olaf Scholz told a news conference.

The decision marks a major turnaround for Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservative-Social Democrat coalition. It abandoned as unachievable a key emissions target shortly before taking office in 2017, only to change course after growing public concerns about climate change fuelled a surge in polls by the Green Party.

“These were tough negotiations,” Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said. “But you can see the result - we are the first country that has a binding agreement to exit coal and nuclear power - and that’s an important signal internationally.”

Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said the legislation would be brought before parliament by the end of January.

The oldest, dirtiest plants, some dating back to the 1950s, will go first, starting with a 300MW plant in the Rhineland scheduled to close this year. Over the following 18 years, the remaining 29 will close.

“What we have here is a good agreement for climate protection because it makes it clear that we mean business,” Altmaier told a news conference.

Caught on the hop when a series of unusually hot summers and the impact of Swedish schoolgirl Greta Thunberg’s Fridays for Future movement caused public opinion to turn, the German government last year introduced a major climate package, which included economy-wide carbon pricing.

The government added on Thursday that carbon emissions certificates held by power stations would be cancelled after they close, a move that should cap emissions and drive up the prices for certificates traded under the European Union’s scheme.

Analysts thought the impact on the coal market would be limited, since EU demand for coal has long stagnated in the face of competition from renewables and gas. Coal prices fell 40% last year and have barely recovered since.

COMPENSATION FOR ALL

The affected states of Brandenburg, Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt in the east and North-Rhine Westphalia in the west will get up to 40 billion euros in compensation from Berlin. Affected companies will get 4.35 billion euros.

They include RWE (RWEG.DE), which according to two government sources will get 2.6 billion euros for shutting down two coal-fired plants, and miner Mibrag, owned by Czech energy group EPH, which will get 1.75 billion euros.

Shares in RWE, Germany’s largest operator of coal-fired power plants, rose as much as 3% to 30.3 euros on the news, their highest level since Sept. 25, 2014.

Energy-intensive companies which compete internationally will be eligible for annual subsidies from 2023 to compensate for higher electricity costs caused by the coal exit, government spokesman Stefan Seibert said, without giving details.

Even so, the BDI industry association criticised the agreement, saying companies had hoped for more help to cope with increased energy costs.

Seibert said that Berlin would also pay compensation to employees affected by the coal exit law up to 2043. The exact sum for each worker remains unclear.

Germany already has plans to phase out hard coal power stations, a process that is already well under way. The new package extends that to brown coal, or lignite, of which Germany is the world’s largest producer.

Slideshow (19 Images)

Brown coal generates about 19% of the country’s electricity, but is considered the most polluting type of coal, partly because its low energy density means more must be burned.

The process will see at least one more coal-fired power station brought online before a complete exit from coal. Utility Uniper’s (UN01.DE) new Datteln 4 coal-fired power plant will be connected to the grid, since the modern unit is cleaner than the first stations to be taken off line.

Elsewhere, the loss of energy caused by the coal exit will be offset by adding natural gas-powered capacity at existing plants, for example at Jaenschwalde in Brandenburg."	https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-germany-coal/germany-adds-brown-coal-to-energy-exit-under-landmark-deal-idUSKBN1ZF0OS

Normandy solar road

Solar roads have long been touted as a possible miracle solution to the world’s energy crisis, as they are less disruptive than wind turbines and can be built atop existing infrastructure. However, the world’s flagship solar road project, the Normandy road in France, has proven to be a failure after two years of operations, with the road only producing around half of the power originally estimated, and engineering issues with the road itself leading to 100m of the road falling into disrepair, and being demolished.

The high volume of traffic has been a contributing factor to both issues, with the solar panels that made up the surface of the road rendered all but useless when objects such as cars pass over them, preventing sunlight from hitting the panels. Falling leaves have also been reported to have caused similar disruptions, highlighting the fragility of operations on the road, and suggesting that the technology may not yet be a robust and reliable source of power.

However, solar roads have seen success elsewhere, with a solar bike lane in the Netherlands exceeding its production expectations in 2018, producing 73kWh per square metre per year, compared to predictions of up to 70kWh. While the road is only 70m long, and so has not produced power on a significant scale, the success of this project suggests there is potential for solar roads to be a contributor to the world’s clean energy mix in the future, if countries and companies can overcome the engineering challenges that plagued the Normandy road.

Medicine Hat solar facility

Earlier this year, the Canadian city of Medicine Hat announced that it would cease operations at a concentrated solar plant after five years due to low production and spiralling expenses. The plant was expected to cost $9m upon completion in 2014, but the city has had to pay an additional $3m to cover overrunning expenses. With the facility producing less than one megawatt of power, Medicine Hat leadership decided to abandon the ineffective facility.

Much of the facility’s struggles have been based on the geography of Canada, which is largely unsuitable for large-scale solar production due to a lack of sunlight. Medicine Hat itself receives an average of 2,544 sunshine hours a year, significantly lower than the 3,470 sunlight hours a year enjoyed by California, the US state with by far the largest solar production. External factors such as declines in the price of natural gas, the energy source solar was intended to replace in the city, have also contributed to the unprofitability of the plant, with consumers more likely to purchase power from natural gas sources, rather than the solar plant.



The plant’s struggles highlight the economic importance of solar projects, and the reality that many will struggle to get off the ground if they do not make money, despite their environmental credentials. However, it is encouraging that a major city has made a significant and reasonably long-term commitment to solar power, and while the geography of Canada may prevent solar projects from ever flourishing there, hope remains that cities in other parts of the world will follow Medicine Hat’s example.

Saudi mega solar plant

While Medicine Hat could be commended for its ambition, other solar projects have aimed for far loftier goals than could be reasonably delivered. In March, Japanese conglomerate SoftBank and the Saudi Public Investment Fund announced plans for a titanic 200GW solar facility, which would increase the country’s solar production by orders of magnitude, from the 50MW installed by the end of 2018, and cost up to $200bn.

However, concerns over financing and support for the project have ultimately undermined its feasibility. Any project of this scale requires coherent and cohesive support from a number of parties, but this project is reported to have gone ahead without consultation with Saudi government officials, and steps on the toes of another raft of state-supported Saudi renewable projects, with the country’s Renewable Energy Project Development Office awarding a contract for a 400MW wind farm for $500m, a project that has both received state backing and is a much more plausible project than the mega-solar plant.

Despite the ultimate failure of the project, it is encouraging to see large-scale solar facilities being constructed, or at least considered in Saudi Arabia. Indeed the country’s targets for solar energy production have constantly being pushed up, from 16GW by 2032 in 2013 to 41GW by 2040 two years later. With annual sunshine hours reaching 3,230, close to that enjoyed by California, there is significant potential for solar projects in the country, provided they can be effectively financed and managed.

India’s cancelled auction

The importance of cross-party support in constructing solar facilities is also highlighted by a recent spate of cancellations of Indian solar projects. In October 2018, the Solar Corporation of India (SECI) cancelled 2.4GW of commissioned solar projects following an auction just four months earlier, wiping almost all of the 3GW that was commissioned off the grid. The dispute stems from significant differences in tariffs quoted by the companies who were awarded the projects in the initial auction, with SECI not willing to see projects with such a range of financial consequences installed under its authority.

While SECI’s stance is understandable, the episode highlights the fragility of the Indian solar sector, and the cancellations will do little to encourage investors to back future solar projects, and anger environmentalists who want to see India take advantage of its reasonable 2,461 sunshine hours per year. Around 8GW of new solar projects were cancelled in 2018, as India struggles to coherently back new solar projects, instead showing support for new investments initially, only to withdraw backing later.

The cancellations are predicted to cripple the country’s solar growth, with Wood Mackenzie reporting that the annual growth rate of new solar installations collapsed from 63% in 2017 to just over 1% in 2018. With India setting an ambitious target of producing 100GW of solar production by 2020, up from an estimated 38GW that will be installed by the end of 2019, confusion surrounding solar auctions and tangible government support for projects could be a significant impediment for the country’s clean energy future."	https://www.power-technology.com/features/solar-failed-projects-struggling/

Cancelled	"HANOI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Vietnam has halted an oil drilling project in the “Red Emperor” block off its southeastern coast licensed to Spanish energy firm Repsol following pressure from China, three sources with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters on Friday.

It would be the second time in less than a year that Vietnam has had to suspend a major oil development in the busy South China Sea waterway under pressure from China.

A source with direct knowledge of the situation said government ministries in Vietnam had paused the project while the decision-making politburo debates whether to suspend or indefinitely terminate the contract.

The decision, which hangs on whether the fees incurred by contract cancellation will exceed the cost of resisting Chinese pressure, is on hold until the politburo meets, the source said.

That meeting has been delayed by overseas trips by Vietnam’s prime minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, a series of visits by foreign dignitaries to Hanoi, and the death of former prime minister Phan Van Khai on Saturday.

“The ministries are determined to terminate the contract,” said the source, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the situation.

A source with direct knowledge of the situation confirmed that the project, which is a joint venture with state oil company PetroVietnam, had been stopped following pressure from China.

A source at Repsol told Reuters high-level executives had been discussing how to respond to the pressure, which had been applied both directly by China, and indirectly via Vietnam.

A spokesman for Repsol in Madrid declined to comment. PetroVietnam executives declined to comment. The Vietnamese foreign ministry did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.

Asked at a regular briefing if China had pressed either Vietnam or Repsol, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said she did not know where such news had come from, but did not elaborate.

“We hope the relevant sides can work together to maintain the hard-earned positive situation in the South China Sea,” she said.

‘RED EMPEROR’

Red Emperor, known in Vietnamese as the Ca Rong Do field, is part of Block 07/03 in the Nam Con Son basin, 440 km (273 miles) off the coast of Vietnam’s southern city of Vung Tau.

The $1-billion field of moderate size by international standards is seen as a key asset to help slow the decline of Vietnam’s stalling oil and gas production.

But the block lies near the U-shaped “nine-dash line” that marks the vast area that China claims in the sea and overlaps what it says are its own oil concessions.

Located in waters around 350 metres (1,148 ft) deep, it is considered to be profitable from around $60 per barrel. Current Brent crude oil prices are almost $70 per barrel.

The field’s estimated potential recovery is around 45 million barrels of crude oil, 172 billion cubic feet of natural gas and 2.3 million barrels of condensate, a super light form of crude oil that is mostly a byproduct of gas production.

Global crude oil, by comparison, is at almost 100 million barrels per day. Global gas consumption is around 4 trillion cubic metres per year.

The move came as Repsol was making final preparations for commercial drilling, according to the BBC, which first reported the news on Friday.

A rig, the Ensco 8504, was due to depart from Singapore for the drill site on Thursday, the BBC said, citing an unnamed energy industry source.

Repsol spent around 33 million euros ($41 million) on exploration in Vietnam last year, according to the company’s 2017 profit and loss statement.

Repsol’s top management considers the Red Emperor site one of the company’s future growth projects.

Repsol, which has a 51.75 percent stake in the project, signed a 384-million-euro rental contract for a rig to start work on a Vietnamese site in 2019, according to the statement.

Just under half the company’s 1 billion euro ($1.23 billion) investments for which contracts have been signed for 2018 are in Vietnam.

Cancelled	"A unit of the Manila Electric Co. is now considering to look for a new contractor to build a planned 600-megawatt power plant at the Redondo Peninsula in Zambales as the previous contractor had proposed a new contract that would make the project nonviable.

Rogelio L. Singson, president and chief executive of Meralco PowerGen Corp. or MGen, yesterday said in a briefing that South Korean firm Doosan group had submitted a proposal that pushed up costs “substantially.”

Redondo Peninsula (RP) Energy Inc. — a partnership among Meralco, Aboitiz Power Corp. and Taiwan Cogeneration Corp. through their respective subsidiaries — last March terminated a P46-billion engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract with Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction Co. Ltd.

According to Doosan, RP Energy cancelled the contract because “the NTP (notice to proceed) for this project was not issued until Dec. 31, 2017, due to delayed tariff approval for the project by the Energy Regulatory Commission” or ERC.

If RP Energy had not cancelled, the company would have been burdened with commitment fees while its application lingered in uncertainty at the ERC.

Both RP Energy and Doosan subsequently said they were in talks related to a revised contract.

Yesterday, Singson said Doosan’s new proposal had raised the project cost too much.

In a separate interview, Singson said the proposal would push down the projects internal rate of return — a measure of profitability — to below 8 percent.

“With interest rates at 7 percent, that would mean we would just be working for the banks,” Singson said.

He added that Doosan suggested a reconfiguration of the project from a coal-fired power plant complex with two generators at 300 MW each to one with a single generator at 600 MW.

“This would reduce the unit cost, but at a different (financing) price,” Singson said. “So now we’re looking at what would be the best EPC contractor available.”

Cancelled	"MADRID (Reuters) - Spain’s Repsol said it had suspended oil drilling in a block off Vietnam, where the prospecting in South China Sea waters claimed by China had infuriated Beijing and brought Chinese pressure on Vietnam to stop.

Tension has been growing between Vietnam and China over energy development in the waterway, where extensive Chinese claims are challenged by five Southeast Asian countries and disputed by the United States.

Repsol’s chief financial officer, Miguel Martinez, said work had been suspended off Vietnam, according to the transcript of a conference call with analysts last week.

“We are working with the PetroVietnam and with the Vietnamese authorities and the only comment is that right now, operations have been suspended,” he said.

“We will have to see what the output is, but as mentioned $27 million is what we have spent till now in this well.”

A Repsol official confirmed the suspension on Wednesday, but declined to give further details.

Drilling began in mid-June in Vietnam’s Block 136/3, which is licensed to Vietnam’s state oil firm, Spain’s Repsol and Mubadala Development Co [MUDEV.UL] of the United Arab Emirates.

The block lies inside the U-shaped “nine-dash line” that marks the vast area that China claims in the sea and overlaps what it says are its own oil concessions.

China had urged a halt to the exploration work and a diplomatic source with direct knowledge of the situation said that the decision to suspend drilling was taken after a Vietnamese delegation visited Beijing.

“Vietnam decided it didn’t want to pick a fight with China over this,” the source said.

Foreign Policy magazine said this week that China had threatened military action against Vietnam if it did not stop the drilling. It said that a decision to stop was made following acrimonious meetings of a divided politburo.

Vietnam has not confirmed the suspension of drilling but last week defended its right to explore in the area.

“Vietnam’s petroleum-related activities take place in the sea entirely under the sovereignty and jurisdiction of Vietnam established in accordance with international law,” Vietnamese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang said.

“Vietnam proposes all concerned parties to respect the legitimate rights and interests of Vietnam.” China claims most of the energy-rich South China Sea through which about $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes every year. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims.

David Shear, a former U.S. ambassador to Vietnam and a former assistant secretary of defense for Asia and Pacific under President Barack Obama, said that he believed that as a result of the spat Vietnam had lost two oil drilling sites.

He blamed it in part on “inattention” by President Donald Trump’s administration in the region.

“This is a setback for the rules-based order and for our interests,” he said.

Thomson Reuters data showed the drilling ship Deepsea Metro I was in the same position on Sunday as it had been since drilling began on the block in the middle of June.

Greg Poling, director of the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies said the suspension of drilling did not mean the contract had been canceled.

“Hanoi could greenlight Repsol drilling another well nearby, but it’s certainly an expensive delay,” he said."	https://www.reuters.com/article/us-southchinasea-vietnam/repsol-says-drilling-suspended-on-vietnam-oil-block-disputed-by-china-idUSKBN1AI27D
Cancelled	"Renewables developers eyeing Saudi Arabia remain wary of the market following the news that the world’s biggest solar project has been canceled.

The $200 billion, 200-gigawatt solar plant planned by SoftBank and the Saudi Public Investment Fund had raised skepticism among developers when it was announced in March, partly because of technical concerns over how it might be integrated into the grid.

The main worry, though, was that the megaproject appeared to have been approved independently of plans for an orderly ramp-up of solar through a tender program managed by the Saudi Renewable Energy Project Development Office (REPDO).

Soon after the SoftBank agreement was unveiled, it emerged that top officials in the kingdom had been excluded from negotiations, adding further uncertainty.

Given the haphazard way in which the deal was brokered — and the fact that the Saudi state and SoftBank had both previously announced plans for massive solar investments that had been canceled — last week’s news came as no surprise.

“Precedent would suggest that grand solar plans from SoftBank or the Saudi state come with a gap between promises and reality,” said Benjamin Attia, global solar analyst with Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables. “This is no exception.”

He said the project never got beyond an initial feasibility study.

According to The Wall Street Journal, the announcement of the freeze was greeted with relief by Saudi energy officials. “Everyone is just hoping this whole idea would just die,” one said.

Although the SoftBank project was widely viewed as being doomed from the start, the cancellation is a further blow to the Saudi solar market.

In 2013, for example, the nation’s King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy set a target of installing 16 gigawatts of PV by 2032. By 2015, the target had gone up to 41 gigawatts, including concentrated solar power, but had been pushed back to 2040.

As of last year, though, Saudi Arabia had installed only 50 megawatts of PV. Before the SoftBank announcement, REPDO had begun to instill a measure of confidence in the market through a series of National Renewable Energy Program (NREP) tenders.

The first of these saw 300 megawatts of solar being awarded to ACWA Power. REPDO was due to issue a second solar tender this year, for 3.3 gigawatts of PV. So far, however, the only tender to come out of the Office in 2018 has been for a $500 million, 400-megawatt wind farm.

REPDO said it received four bids in July and committed to picking a winner in December.

The WSJ said Saudi officials are now working on a revised strategy, which should be unveiled at an investor conference called the Future Investment Initiative 2018, happening in late October in Riyadh.

Developers and investors will most likely be hoping to see REPDO back in charge of proceedings. “REPDO's leadership in the NREP Round I tender last year was generally very good,” Attia said.

Putting the SoftBank project on the backburner “is a step in the right direction for investor certainty,” he said. However, he added: “The Saudi solar market's future is still in limbo until the stated ‘broader, more practical’ renewables strategy is announced in about a month.”

Until then, he said, there is still no indication on how the SoftBank memorandum of understanding that has now been sidelined might affect the Round II tenders that were due this year.

“It's possible that things go back to normal, like this never happened,” Attia said, “Alternatively, the lingering uncertainty and larger project size could drive a less competitive Round II tender. We'll have to wait and see the details of the new renewables strategy in a few weeks.”

That’s if the announcement actually takes place as planned, of course. In the stop-start world of Saudi solar, developers and investors are learning to take nothing for granted."	https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/saudi-outlook-remains-uncertain-after-softbank-pulls-out
Cancelled	"Saudi Arabia has reportedly cancelled a $200bn solar project with Japan’s SoftBank just months after launching it.

Cancelled	"SINGAPORE - The joint project between Singapore and Andhra Pradesh to develop the state's new capital called Amaravati has been officially terminated, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry in a press statement on Tuesday (Nov 12).

The statement noted that the decision by the government of Andhra Pradesh to close the Amaravati Capital City Start-Up Area project via a government order dated Nov 11 is based on mutual consent between the Andhra Pradesh government and a Singapore consortium.

""Following the change in scenario for the development of Amaravati Capital City, it is no longer feasible to develop the Amaravati Capital City Start-up Area as originally planned,"" said Singapore Amaravati Investment Holdings (SAIH) in a separate statement.

""Therefore, our joint development company Amaravati Development Partners (ADP) and the state government of Andhra Pradesh have mutually agreed to terminate the project.""

In the press statement by MTI, Minister-in-charge of Trade Relations S. Iswaran said: ""We note that the newly elected government of Andhra Pradesh has decided not to proceed with the start-up area given its other priorities for the state.

""Companies recognise such risks when venturing into any overseas market and factor them into their investment decisions...

""Singapore companies remain interested in opportunities in Andhra Pradesh and other Indian states because of the size and potential of the market. Our economic agencies will continue to help our companies internationalise by exploring opportunities in India and other overseas markets.""

He also noted that the Singapore consortium companies have stated that the project has cost them a few million dollars, and that its closure does not impact their investment plans in India.

SAIH said in its statement: ""As the project is still at its early stages and the land in the start-up area has yet to be made available to ADP for development, costs incurred are limited to design services prior to commencement of execution works on the ground, amounting to a few million dollars.""

In September, Mr Iswaran had told Parliament that Singapore companies involved in the project were evaluating their investment.

No state funds had been used for the project, he had said.

""In terms of whether there were any subsidies or grants by the Government for investments in the state, the answer is no.""

He said then that the companies' commercial discussions were confidential and he was not privy to the details of their total investment.

The Andhra Pradesh government sought Singapore's help in 2014 to plan the new capital. It was the brainchild of its then Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu.

Subsequently, a consortium of Ascendas-Singbridge, now part of CapitaLand Group, and Sembcorp Development was awarded a joint venture opportunity to develop the city.

After Mr Naidu's election defeat by Mr Jagan Mohan Reddy's YSR Congress party in May this year, the World Bank withdrew US$300 million (S$417 million) in funding for the project, after the central government stopped supporting it.

SAIH said that termination of the project should not ""in any way"" impact CapitaLand's and SAIH's investment plans in India, which remains a key market for both companies.

The project closure is also not expected to have a material impact on the earnings per share and net asset value per share of Sembcorp Industries for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2019, it said.

Ms Laurel Ostfield, spokesman for Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), had told The Straits Times in September that ""AIIB is no longer considering the Amaravati Sustainable Infrastructure and Institutional Development Project for funding"", reiterating an earlier announcement the bank made in July.

Mr Reddy, in criticising the project, claimed the land rates were fixed under the previous administration.

Other reports claimed he was trying to erase the political legacy of his electoral rival.

Cancelled	"A Singapore consortium and the Andhra Pradesh government have cancelled the proposed multi-billion-dollar capital city Amaravati project on ""mutual consent"", with a senior minister making it clear that the scrapping of the venture will not impact the city-state's investment plans in India.

The capital city, initially estimated to cost SGD15 billion, was the brainchild of the state's former chief minister, N Chandrababu Naidu, who lost power in elections in May.

Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) said on Tuesday the decision was based on mutual consent between the Andhra Pradesh State government and the Singapore consortium, consisting of Ascendas Singapore, which is now part of CapitaLand Group, and Sembcorp Development.

The decision to close the Amaravati Capital City Start-Up Area project was made by Andhra Pradesh, headed by Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy, in a government order on Monday.

Singapore's Surbana Jurong was the lead consultant in planning, urban design and conducting economic studies, positioning and infrastructure-industrial estate planning, according to the company's website.

A total of 7,000 sq km had been slated for land use for the capital region, and almost 50 million people had been projected to be involved in the urbanisation project, said Surbana Jurong.

The Ascendas-Sembcorp consortium was appointed by the then Andhra Pradesh government in 2017 to develop a 6.84 sq km start-up area for the state's planned new capital city, said Minister-in-charge of Trade Relations S Iswaran.

The Andhra Pradesh government has decided not to proceed with the project ""given its other priorities for the state"", the minister noted.

Companies recognise such risks when venturing into any overseas market and factor them into their investment decisions, said Iswaran.

In this instance, the Singapore Consortium companies have stated that the project has cost them a few million dollars, and that its closure does not impact their investment plans in India, he said.

Singapore companies remain interested in opportunities in Andhra Pradesh and other Indian states because of the size and potential of the market, he assured.

""Our economic agencies will continue to help our companies internationalise by exploring opportunities in India and other overseas markets,"" said Iswaran on India-Singapore ties.

The project was the first major real-estate venture that the previous Telugu Desam Party's government had undertaken under the Public Private Partnership mode and selected the Singapore consortium of through the controversial Swiss Challenge method as the Master Developer.

Since December 2014, Singapore had been playing a vital role in building Amaravati, a city which had to be created from scratch after Andhra Pradesh lost its former capital Hyderabad to the newly formed state of Telangana.



The cancellation came after the World Bank in July withdrew a US$300 million funding for Amaravati's construction, following the Indian central government's decision to cease its support for the project.



It also prompted the Beijing-backed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), which was due to finance US$200 million of the project, to review its involvement.

Noting that companies recognise the risks involved in overseas ventures and factor them into their investment decisions, Mr Iswaran said: ""In this instance the Singapore Consortium companies have stated that the project has cost them a few million dollars, and that its closure does not impact their investment plans in India.""



He added that Singapore companies continue to take interest in opportunities in Andhra Pradesh and other Indian states ""because of the size and potential of the market"".

""Our economic agencies will continue to help our companies internationalise by exploring opportunities in India and other overseas markets,” said Mr Iswaran."	https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/amaravati-project-cancelled-andhra-pradesh-ascendas-sembcorp-12085918
Cancelled	"An MOU between Saudi Arabia and Softbank was signed in March.

In March, a memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed between the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia and Japan-based SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son, to establish a US$200 billion, 200 GW solar project in Saudi Arabia.

According to the Wall Street Journal yesterday, which cites unnamed Saudi government officials, these plans have now been shelved, with no one actively working on the project.

Instead, the officials said, Saudi Arabia is working on a new, “more practical” renewable energy strategy, which is expected to be announced some time this month.

Ambitious plans

At a briefing in New York back in March, Softbank’s Son said the mega project would encompass equipment manufacturing and battery storage, in addition to solar systems, with the potential for up to 100,000 jobs to be created and $40 billion in power cost savings.

Popular content

SoftBank originally intended to invest the funds via its Vision Fund – the largest technology investment fund, ever, and which has backing from Saudi Arabia and the UAE; and companies including Apple, Sharp and Foxconn.

As a first phase, $1 billion was expected to be invested in installing 7.2 GW of new capacity over a two year time period.

Already in March, Bloomberg NEF questioned the ambitious plans. “It’s a memorandum of understanding, it doesn’t really mean much. Saudi Arabia has a long history of announcing big numbers on a long timeframe, and these are usually subject to substantial revision,” Jenny Chase, head of solar told pv magazine.

She added, “The first phase of 7.2 GW is the more interesting number to keep an eye on – big, but likely to happen in a timeframe we can foresee. That said, in principle Softbank has a huge appetite for making investments, and Saudi has growing energy demand – as also evidenced by its nuclear announcements of 16 reactors in the next 25 years.”"	https://www.pv-magazine.com/2018/10/01/200-gw-saudi-softbank-solar-plans-abandoned-reports/
Cancelled	"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A decision on Monday by Mexico’s next president to scrap a partly built $13 billion Mexico City airport has raised questions about the feasibility of his alternative plan, and consequences of the change.

Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who takes office Dec. 1, justified his move based on the results of an informal referendum that called for abandoning the current project.

The U-turn is the latest step in a long-running saga over how to solve growing congestion at the Mexico City airport, where 40 million passengers pass through a year.

WHAT IS LOPEZ OBRADOR’S ALTERNATIVE PLAN?

Lopez Obrador aims to add two runways to the military air base at Santa Lucia, some 29 miles (47 km) by road north of the current facility, Benito Juarez International Airport, then connect the two. He said it can be done for 70 billion pesos ($3.5 billion).

The plan also envisions upgrading the Benito Juarez hub and Toluca International Airport 41 miles (66 km) away for about 5 billion pesos, and connect the latter by train to the capital. The projects would be completed in three years and altogether save some 100 billion pesos, according to Lopez Obrador.

WHAT ARE THE DOUBTS ABOUT THE PROPOSAL?

Engineering consultancy Mitre Corporation said the Santa Lucia site may not be able to operate simultaneously with the Benito Juarez airport due to conflicting flight paths. Javier Jimenez Espriu, Lopez Obrador’s designated transport minister, rejects that view.

The business community has argued that Santa Lucia’s distance from the capital will deter tourism and could complicate travel for connecting flights from Mexico City.

WHAT ARE THE PLAN’S BENEFITS?

Lopez Obrador’s team said the new airport being built on the bed of Lake Texcoco on the capital’s eastern flank would be too expensive to maintain because of the complex geology.

Canceling it would avoid damage to the city’s water table and benefit local ducks, Lopez Obrador said. He wants the Texcoco site to become an ecological park.

Without providing evidence, Lopez Obrador has said the Texcoco project was tainted by graft. He argues the cancellation of the project will send out a message in Mexico that corruption between business interests and politicians is over.

WHAT CONSEQUENCES COULD CANCELLATION TRIGGER?

By choosing to dump a project that has received billions of dollars in investment - the outgoing government said the Texcoco airport is about one-third complete - markets are reassessing Lopez Obrador’s commitment to existing laws and agreements.

That could negatively affect Mexico’s ability to attract investment under Lopez Obrador, who argues he has “moral authority” to call the present system into question.

Billions of dollars were wiped off the value of the stock market on Monday during a sell-off by investors.

The airport’s cancellation may require the government to put up extra funds to pre-pay bonds issued to finance it, outgoing President Enrique Pena Nieto said. The group building the Texcoco hub issued $6 billion in bonds and $1.5 billion in an investment trust, backed by the current airport passenger tax.

WILL FIRMS INVOLVED KEEP THEIR CONTRACTS?

Jimenez Espriu said companies already contracted by the airport group may be able to transfer their contracts to Santa Lucia, or reach new agreements. Lopez Obrador said he will honor existing agreements but has not provided details.

Among the business leaders most exposed to the cancellation of the Texcoco airport is the country’s richest man, Carlos Slim, whose family has been co-designing, co-building and co-financing the project that began construction in 2015."	https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-airport/what-is-next-for-mexico-city-airport-after-mega-project-axed-idUSKCN1N51BQ

Pakistan’s relations with Beijing are so close that officials call China their “Iron Brother”. Despite that, plans for the Diamer-Bhasha Dam were thrown into turmoil in November when the chairman of Pakistan’s water authority said Beijing wanted an ownership stake in the hydropower project. He rejected that as against Pakistani interests.

China issued a denial but the official withdrew the dam from among dozens of projects being jointly developed by the two countries.

From Pakistan to Tanzania to Hungary, projects under President Xi Jinping’s signature ‘Belt and Road Initiative’ are being cancelled, renegotiated or delayed due to disputes about costs or complaints that host countries get too little out of the projects.

In some areas, Beijing is suffering a political backlash due to fears of domination by Asia’s biggest economy.

Belt and Road, announced by Mr. Xi in 2013, is a loosely defined umbrella for Chinese-built or -financed projects across 65 countries from the South Pacific through Asia to Africa and Europe. Other governments welcomed the initiative in a region the Asian Development Bank says needs more than $26 trillion of infrastructure investment by 2030 to keep economies growing. Nations including Japan have given or lent billions of dollars for development, but China’s venture is bigger and the only source of money for many projects.

Derailed projects

Among projects that have been derailed or disrupted, authorities in Nepal cancelled plans in November for Chinese companies to build a $2.5 billion dam after they concluded contracts for the Budhi Gandaki Hydro Electric Project violated rules requiring multiple bidders.

Cancelled	"303 mile pipeline expansion in Azerbaijan is the first leg of a 1,993 mile journey to southern Europe

Construction or preliminary work has begun on three pipelines designed to flow natural gas supplies from Azerbaijan to consumers in Turkey, Bulgaria, Greece and Italy, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). The South Caucasus Pipeline Expansion (SCPX) is proposed to take natural gas from Russia, Central Asia and the Middle East to consumers in southern Europe.

Over the past decade projects including Nabucco, which was planned to transport natural gas through southeastern Europe to connect with existing natural gas pipelines in or near Austria, South Stream, proposed to carry gas out of Russia and into Bulgaria and eastern Europe, have been cancelled. The future of Turkish Stream, the proposed alternative to South Stream that would land in Turkey rather than Bulgaria, also remains uncertain, with Russian state-owned monopoly Gazprom (ticker: OGZPY) cancelling its contract with Saipem (ticker: SPM), the Italian company contracted to lay the first part of the pipeline.

Construction began on the SCPX pipeline, which runs from Azerbaijan to the Georgia-Turkey border, at the end of June. It will connect with the Trans-Anatolian Natural Gas Pipeline (TANAP) from there and continue to the Turkey-Greece border, which officially started construction in March 2015. The final portion of the pipeline, the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP), which is expected to begin construction in 2016, will take the gas from the Turkey-Greece border to Italy.

SCPX will incorporate two pipeline loops for a total distance of 487 km (303 mi), while TANAP is expected to stretch 1,850 km (1,150 mi), and the final portion of the pipeline runs 870 km (540 mi) to its final destination in Italy. The total distance of the project will be 3,207 km (1,993 mi).

20 billion cubic meters of gas per year

SCPX and TANAP are scheduled to start operations by 2019, with plans for start-up on TAP set for 2020. Turkey and Italy have contracts to receive 0.6 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) and 0.8 Bcf/d of of natural gas, respectively, while Greece and Bulgaria each are contracted to take 0.1 Bcf/d.

The original South Caucasus Pipeline (SCP) was built to export Shah Deniz gas from Azerbaijan to Georgia and Turkey, starting from the Sanggachal terminal near Baku, Azerbaijan, and following the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) crude oil pipeline through Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey, where it is linked to the Turkish gas distribution system. The SCP Co. shareholders are BP (ticker: BP; operator, 28.8% interest), AzSCP (10.0% interest), TPAO (19% interest), Petronas (15.5% interest), Lukoil (10.0% interest), NICO (10.0% interest) and SGC Midstream (6.7% interest).

According to BP, the expansion project will involve the construction of two new compressor stations in Georgia, which will triple the gas volumes exported through the pipeline to over 20 Bcm per year.

Avoiding Russia

Although historically an oil producer, Azerbaijan’s importance as a natural gas producer and exporter is growing. Until 2007, Azerbaijan was a net importer of natural gas, largely dependent on imports from Russia. Azerbaijan was also dependent on Russia as a transit country for its oil exports until 2006. The Baku-Tblisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline, which began operating in 2006, and the South Caucasus Pipeline, which began operating in 2007, provided transportation capacity out of the Caspian region that did not rely on crossing Russian territory.

European markets are increasingly looking for new sources of natural gas as relationships with Russia turn sour. New projects like SCPX have put more pressure on Russia as its pivot to Asian markets has proved to be less fruitful than it had originally hoped. “Russia is realizing the situation, and having to adapt their strategy in Europe,” Dr. James Henderson of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies told Oil & Gas 360 in an exclusive interview.

Other proposed pipelines

Plans are also in the works to build a bidirectional pipeline called Eastring from Slovakia, through Hungary and Romania, connecting to Turkey through the existing Trans-Balkan pipeline. Future possibilities for moving natural gas to Turkey and Europe also involve natural gas exports from Iran and Iraq. The lifting of sanctions on Iran would allow European countries to import gas from Iran. Although Iran already exports natural gas to Turkey, it has long had plans to export larger volumes of natural gas through Turkey to Europe. However, other hurdles would remain, including agreeing on a natural gas price and meeting Iran’s growing domestic demands for natural gas, especially for enhanced oil recovery, power generation, and winter heating.

Turkey continues to negotiate with the Kurdish Regional government and the Iraqi government on building a natural gas pipeline from northern Iraq to Turkey; while no agreement has been reached, BOTAS, Turkey’s state-owned pipeline company, has begun extending the domestic natural gas transmission system to the Iraqi border."	https://www.oilandgas360.com/new-pipeline-will-triple-azerbaijans-natgas-piped-to-europe-avoiding-russia/

The planned AMBO trans-Balkan pipeline project to pump crude oil fromthe Bulgarian Black Sea port of Burgas via Macedonia to the Albanian AdriaticSea port of Vlore is still viable, the project's co-founder said in a recentinterview.

Gligor Tashkovich, the former Macedonian foreign investment minister andboard member of AMBO, said the project has kept a low profile in recent yearswhile seeking major investors and waiting for the timing of the project tomaterialize.

""AMBO is still moving forward,"" Tashkovich said this month, withcompleting the financing being the immediate stumbling block.

But the announcement in December 2010 of the expansion of theChevron-led Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) pipeline gave the AMBO projecta boost.

""It cements AMBO's long-term development prospects,"" he said.

The 890 km AMBO pipeline is designed as a 750,000 b/d transit link thatwould divert new volumes of Caspian crude sent to the Black Sea away from thecrowded Bosporus Strait which bisects Turkey.

AMBO was first conceived in the summer of 1993. Along with the other twomain Bosporus bypass pipeline projects--Burgas-Alexandroupolis and Turkey'sSamsun-Ceyhan--AMBO has faced long delays because the crude oil that wassupposed to arrive in the Black Sea in sufficient quantities to fill one ormore of these lines back in the late 1990s has still not arrived.

Tied to the availability of crude oil in the Black Sea is the issue offinancing.

Investors, including oil companies, that are prepared to put up riskmoney are the first requirement in projects such as AMBO.

""Banks are reluctant to fund pipeline projects that don't have acontractually guaranteed oil supply. However, once investors have providedthe required funding and shippers have committed their oil, debt financing bythe banks will follow,"" Tashkovich said.

""If one of the Middle East sovereign wealth funds wants to finance AMBO,we would certainly welcome their interest,"" he said.

GOOD POSITION

But AMBO plans to be in a good position to ship the extra oil expectedto begin entering the Black Sea from 2013.

""Currently, most Caspian region production is destined for Westernmarkets hence the need for a western bypass of the Turkish Straits,""Tashkovich said.

Earlier this year, Chevron officially launched its $5.4 billion projectto double the capacity of the CPC oil route to 67 million mt/year (1.34million b/d) by 2015.

The new volumes are to come mainly from Kazakhstan's Tengiz andKarachaganak projects, where crude output has been increasing, perhaps alsofrom new projects, such as Russia's Korchagin field that launched earlierthis year and Kazakhstan's Kashagan, whose start-up is scheduled for 2015.

However, an increase in oil being shipped from Black Sea ports toMediterranean markets through the Bosporus is expected to lead to even longerdelays because of the added congestion.

This is especially visible during the extended winter season which runsfrom mid-November into April.

Naturally, there are also increased fears of an environmental disasterin the Bosporus as the level of oil traffic rises.

Tashkovich stressed that AMBO was not competing with any other Bosporusbypass pipeline projects, but said nonetheless that AMBO's economics weresuperior to the others.

""When people study the economics of our pipeline, we are certain thatAMBO will hold up to the additional scrutiny,"" he said.

Tashkovich also said that a tripartite convention has enshrined the AMBOproject in Bulgarian, Macedonian and Albanian law.

The convention, which was negotiated and signed in 2007 at ministeriallevel, has been successfully ratified by all three parliaments, he said.

""It now has the status of a legal treaty. We have a turnkey project; weare just waiting until the oil actually arrives,"" he said.

ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES

Despite the positives, AMBO would also have to carry out anEnvironmental and Social Impact Assessment Study (ESIA) on the whole projectbefore any construction permits in the three countries can be awarded.

This has also been an obstacle to Burgas-Alexandroupolis.

AMBO President and CEO Ted Ferguson told Platts that once financing forthe project is secured, it would move to carry out the ESIA.

""While AMBO completed an Environmental Impact Assessment study forfeasibility purposes, this in no way can be construed to be sufficient forthe development phase,"" Ferguson said.

""A full ESIA requires at least a year studying the 'right of way' andorganizing numerous meetings of the communities potentially impacted by thepipeline,"" he said.

AMBO, Ferguson said, has been very clear in its planning that the ESIAwould not be undertaken until AMBO has received sufficient financial interestin the project.

""We are confident that financial interest will materialize as soon ascrude oil will predictably flow into the Black Sea in greater volumes,"" hesaid.

Highlights Nepal cancelled the Budhi Gandaki hydropower project which had been contracted to a Chinese company.

Unconfirmed reports said the project might go to India’s NHPC instead.

Nepal’s decision comes a few years after Myanmar decided to cancel the $3.6 billion Myitsone dam in 2011 by former president Thein Sein

NEW DELHI/BEIJING: In a decision which could have far reaching consequences in the region and for China, Nepal cancelled the Budhi Gandaki hydropower project which had been contracted to a Chinese company. Unconfirmed reports said the project might go to India’s NHPC instead.

Nepal’s deputy PM Kamal Thapa tweeted the decision on Tuesday, “The agreement, marred by irregularities with the Chinese company, Gezhouba Group , regarding the construction of Budhi Gandaki hydropower project, has been scrapped in a cabinet meeting as directed by the parliamentary committee.”

Asked about the development, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said, “I am not aware of this information. China and Nepal have sound relations and bilateral cooperation covers a wide range of areas.”

The decision is significant, since the agreement with the Chinese company came weeks after Nepal agreed to join Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative.

China’s Gezhouba Water and Power Co Ltd had won the contract from the then Maoist-led government headed by former PM Pushpa Kamal Dahal aka Prachanda over a year ago. It was meant to be a water storage dam along the Budhi Gandaki river in the central and western regions of Nepal.

Nepal’s decision comes a few years after Myanmar decided to cancel the $3.6 billion Myitsone dam in 2011 by former president Thein Sein. In fact, China said as recently as last week that it would “ continue” talking to Myanmar on the issue.

Both have proved to be big setbacks to China’s project of creating a web of regional connectivity networks. It is likely the Nepalese decision was influenced by India , which has pointed to Sri Lanka and the debt trap it finds itself in after the Hambantota port project.

While China has been an attractive alternative for Nepal after many years of squabbling with India, where hydro-projects have been a casualty, now Beijing has another player. The US, working closely with India, has earmarked one of its generous grants to Nepal for regional connectivity as part of the larger Indo-Pacific outreach.

Testifying in the US Congress recently, Alice Wells, acting assistant secretary of state, said, “Nepal has been selected for one of the US’ most high profile projects to increase regional connectivity within the Indo-Pacific.”

In August, she said the Millennium Challenge Corporation’s (MCC) board of directors approved a $500 million compact with Nepal, MCC’s first compact in South Asia. Both projects have been decided in consultation with India.

The larger trend here is a pushback to Beijing’s unilateral connectivity initiative, by India, the US and Japan to work out sustainable transparent alternatives to address local and regional infrastructure needs.

India has expressed concerns about the predatory financing mechanisms employed by China under the OBOR in small, poor countries like Nepal and Sri Lanka which puts them in a debt trap to the Chinese and might impact their foreign policy choices.

Cancelled	"Sierra Leone has cancelled a troubled $400m airport development that was funded by China on the grounds that it already has one that is operating well below capacity.

The Mamamah International Airport would have been located near to Freetown, Sierra Leone’s capital, and would have taken over from the country’s current main airport in the town of Lungi.



Lungi airport, a former British air base with an annual passenger capacity of 170,000, is located on the other side of the Freetown estuary, requiring visitors who land there to travel by boat to Freetown. Despite the small size of Lungi, it is far from reaching capacity.



Mamamah Airport was an initiative of former Sierra Leone president Ernest Bai Koroma, but a new government led by Julius Maada Bio, elected in April 2018, decided there was no business case for it.



The Daily Nation, quotes a letter sent by the government to the director of the Mamamah project. It said: “After serious consideration and due diligence, it is government’s view that it is uneconomical to proceed with the construction of a new airport when the existing one is grossly under-utilised”.



When first announced in 2011, Sierra Leone’s economy was booming, mainly due to a surge in the price of iron ore, the country’s main export.

Former Sierra Leone president Koroma and Jinping in China in 2015 (Ministry of Foreign Affairs, China)

It is unclear how much work on the project had been completed, but Balogun Koroma, the minister of transport and aviation, told a local news site in early 2016 that Mamamah would be constructed “at all costs”.



“We cannot allow this project to be killed,” he said, “as the Chinese construction team has already done all the basic work and they are just waiting for the contract to be signed.”



When announced, the development came under scrutiny from the International Monetary Fund, which told Africa Confidential that the plan was a “vanity project”.



The fund recently travelled to Sierra Leone, and published a report, saying the country’s “economic environment remains challenging, with output growth still recovering from the recent loss in iron ore mining and reduced activity in the non-mining sectors”.



The World Bank was also against the project, and has previously invested $200m in upgrades to Lungi Airport.



In 2015, the Sierra Leone Telegraph, argued that President Koroma should “use common sense and compassion to focus on health, education, the provision of water and electricity, and forget about his politically inspired, crackpot and wasteful idea of building a grandiose second international airport, costing over $400m”.



Despite the cancellation, the BBC quotes Wu Peng, China's ambassador to Sierra Leone, saying: “I don't think the airport project should affect our future bilateral relations.”

Cancelled	"KATHMANDU, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Nepal has scrapped a $2.5 billion deal with China Gezhouba Group Corporation to build the country’s biggest hydropower plant, citing lapses in the award process, the energy minister said.

“The cabinet has cancelled the irregular ... agreement with Gezhouba Group to build the Budhi Gandaki hydroelectric project,” Energy Minister Kamal Thapa, who is also the country’s deputy prime minister, said on Monday in a twitter post in Nepali after a cabinet meeting. He did not give further details.

Nepal’s rivers, cascading from the snow-capped Himalayas, have vast, untapped potential for hydropower generation, but lack of funds and technology have made Nepal lean on neighbour India to meet annual demand of 1,400 megawatts (MW).

In June a Maoist-dominated coalition government awarded a contract to China Gezhouba Group Corporation to build a 1,200 MW plant on the Budhi Gandaki river, about 50 km (32 miles) west of Kathmandu, to address acute power shortages.

Critics say the $2.5 billion project was handed to the Chinese company without any competitive bidding, which is required by law, and a parliamentary panel asked the government that succeeded the Maoist-led coalition to scrap the deal.

Officials of the Chinese company were not immediately available for comment.

China and India jostle for influence with aid and investment in infrastructure projects in Nepal.

Kathmandu has cleared a 750 MW project to be built on the West Seti River in the western part of the country by China’s state-owned Three Gorges International Corp.

It has also permitted two Indian companies - GMR Group and Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam Limited - to build one hydropower plant each, both capable of generating 900 MW of power each, mainly to be exported to India.

Cancelled	"The Turkish Akkuyu nuclear power plant (NPP) project has restarted after the Turkish Government signed a deal with the Russian Government. The intergovernmental cooperation agreement on the NPP was ratified in 2010.

Delayed in 1999 and cancelled in 2000, the project was originally intended to produce 3,000MW. The first unit was commissioned in 2006 and the second in December 2007.

The first unit is expected to achieve its first criticality in the second half of 2019. The remaining three units will come online in yearly intervals once Unit I begins commercial operations in 2020. The project is estimated to cost $20bn and will be Turkey’s first nuclear power plant.

The foundation for the power plant’s offshore hydraulic engineering structures (OHES) was laid in April 2015. The Cengiz Insaat Sanayi ve Ticaret JSC (joint stock company) was awarded a $394m contract to design and construct OHES.

The Akkuyu site is connected by sea, enabling transportation of heavy machinery to the site. It is close to centres of electricity consumption such as Adana, Konya, Antalya and Mersin. There is also a relatively lower population density in the region.

The first public hearing session on the project’s environmental impact assessment (EIA) report was held in March 2012. Participants of the meeting, especially representatives from Greenpeace, objected to the EIA, saying that it fails to address the environmental impacts of the plant.

The EIA report was approved by Turkey’s Ministry of Environment and Urbanisation in December 2014.

Developer for the nuclear power plant project

The nuclear plant will be built, owned and operated by a Russian subsidiary of Rosatom, a state-owned nuclear company. In December 2010, Rosatom created a project company named the Akkuyu Electricity Generation JSC. JSC Atomstroyexport, JSC Concern Rosenergoatom, Atomenergoremont and Atomtekhenergo, and JSC Inter Rao Ees founded the new company. Foreign investors are allowed to invest up to 49% in the new company.

State-owned company Elektrik Uretim (EUAS) provides the site required for the four reactors.

Akkuyu NPP scheme background and history

“The project is estimated to cost $20bn and is Turkey’s first nuclear power plant.”

Bidding for the plant was originally announced on 13 December 1996. Bids were received by October 1997. The contract was supposed to have been awarded in October 1999, but the deadline was extended to 31 December 1999 and the project was eventually cancelled in July 2000.

The plant was first suggested in the 1970s, and bids were invited in 1977. However, the project fell through for financial reasons. The second round of bidding was originally for a turnkey project, but this was changed to a build-operate-transfer (BOT).

Discussions with a Canadian consortium led by AECL fell through partly for financial reasons, and partially because the Chernobyl accident threw uncertainty over the whole project. In the mid-1990s, the project was resumed, creating the current round of bidding.

Two bids for the 3,000MW plant were originally requested. The first (main) option had to have a maximum net output of 1,400MW (with one or two units according to the size offered). The second option was to have a maximum net output of 2,800 MW (two or four units according to the size offered). Both options highlight an output increase of 5%. The plant could be PWR, BWR or PHWR. The minimum unit size was 600MW, and the minimum plant size was 800MW.

The accepted bidder had to meet several criteria, such as five years of experience with this type of power plant, licensed to operate in the country, previous experience of constructing and commissioning at least two nuclear plants, designation of a reference plant similar to Akkuyu and designs must not have had a previous accident.

Turnkey basis for the bid and bidder responsibilities for the Turkish facility

The bid was to be for a nuclear power plant on a turnkey basis. This was to comprise a nuclear and turbine island, fuel storage system (with 20 years spent fuel capacity), coolant water intake and outlet structures and GIS Substation of 154kV and 380kV. In addition, the successful bidder had to supply two years fuel (during the warranty period), with an option to supply fuel for a total of seven years.

The bidder would supply spare parts and supervise the plant for the two-year warranty period, and an option for an additional three years thereafter. The bidder would train the plant staff and construct the ancillary facilities.

Bids were submitted by three consortia, namely Atomic Energy of Canada, in partnership with Turkish firms Guris and Gama Bayinder; Westinghouse-Mitsubishi, in partnership with Turkish firms MNG and Enka; and NPI (Fromatone and Siemens), in partnership with Turkish firms Simko, Garanti Koza, STFA and Telefon.

Concerns over the Turkish nuclear power plant facility

Largely because of nuclear’s high ‘hidden’ costs and waste disposal problems, environmental groups tend to oppose all nuclear projects. In the case of Turkey, the area is also prone to earthquakes, with a 6.2 Richter-scale earthquake having hit Adana, 180km from the plant site.

“The nuclear plant will be built, owned and operated by a Russian subsidiary of Rosatom, a state-owned nuclear company.”

While the plant is being designed to withstand earthquakes of up to 6.5 on the Richter scale, the possibility of a stronger quake has caused concerns.

Another reason for resistance in western countries is the possibility of nuclear weapons. Civil power plants can produce plutonium for military uses. The volatility of internal Turkish politics, along with the country’s chequered history with some of its neighbours, has made this another matter for concern.

Mersin residents were also displeased with the government’s decision to go ahead with the Akkuyu NPP project. In April 2011, an anti-nuclear human chain was formed in the western quarters of the city to protest the decision.

Power purchase agreement guarantee for Turkey’s Akkuyu nuclear power plant

Turkish Electricity Trade and Contract Corporation (TETAS) guaranteed the purchase of 70% power generated from the first two units and 30% from the third and fourth units over a 15-year power purchase agreement. Electricity will be purchased at a price of 12.35¢/kWh and the remaining power will be sold in the open market by the producer."	https://www.power-technology.com/projects/akkuyu/

April 4, 2018, Hpa-An, Myanmar – Myanmar Union Minister of Electricity and Energy U Win Khaing announced at a press conference on March 14 that the Myanmar government will not grant permission for the proposed 1,280 MW coal power plant in Hpa-An, Karen State. Local communities and civil society groups who have campaigned tirelessly against the proposed coal plant are celebrating this victory and welcome the news from the new Minister of Energy.

“We are very happy and appreciative to hear the announcement of the Union Minister that this project has been cancelled. Despite our happiness at the result, we remain cautious. We hope that state-level government representatives will help reduce our concerns by following in the footsteps of the Union Minister and announcing their support for the project’s cancellation.” said Saw Aung Than Htwe, a member of one of the Hpa-An communities.

We, the undersigned 131 organizations and networks call on the Myanmar Union government to follow up on the Minister’s statement and officially cancel all proposed and suspended coal-fired power plants. We also call on the government to pass a national moratorium on coal power plants because of the devastating and irreparable harm they would cause to the environment and people of Myanmar. We further call on the government to create policies and laws to promote and regulate the implementation of sustainable renewable energy projects that are consistent with the needs and wishes of communities.

In April 2017, the Karen State Government (KSG and Toyo Thai Power Myanmar Co Ltd (TTCL) signed a memorandum of understanding to conduct a feasibility study for the proposed Hpa-An coal plant. In June 2017, 42 Karen State-based civil society organizations and 130 other civil society organizations released a statement against the project. In October 2017, the KSG and TTCL signed joint venture and lease agreements for 815 acres with a concession period of 40 years. The proposed project site was on the Thanlwin (Salween) River. Local civil society groups collected around 2,980 signatures from Karen State residents who opposed the project and submitted them to the Karen State Chief Minister. In November 2017, local communities gathered to demonstrate against the project. Despite knowledge of this opposition, TTCL persuaded the KSG to organize people from Hpa-An to go and visit Hekinan coal-fired power plant in Japan in an attempt to influence and promote their project in Hpa-An.

“Although the project has been declared cancelled at Union level this remains unclear at state level. Public access to information on the project remains limited, and land has recently been purchased by TTCL in the project area,” said Saw Nay Lin Htun, a member of one of the Hpa-An communities.

It was also reported that TTCL attempted to implement the Hpa-An project in Karen State after having failed to do so in Ann Dinn, Mon State. The local communities in Ann Dinn strongly opposed this project. Around 5,000 people protested the project in 2015, and a result of this strong and continuous opposition, the Ann Dinn project was cancelled.

Communities in Myanmar have continuously opposed coal-fired power plant projects throughout Myanmar, expressing serious concerns over forced relocation from their lands, pollution to the air and water, the resulting loss of livelihoods, and harmful consequences to their health.

Renewable energy options also make projects such as the one proposed for Hpa-An unnecessary and inexcusable. Developing countries are installing renewable energy projects almost twice as fast as developed countries. Among the factors contributing to this shift is the decreasing cost of component materials and increasing efficiency of renewable energy technologies. In addition, renewable energy projects can bring electricity to communities across Myanmar much quicker than coal power plants and large hydropower projects.

Rural communities in Myanmar have already successfully implemented more than 3,500 off-grid sustainable renewable energy projects that are consistent with local energy needs and conserve existing natural resources.

“This moment presents an opportunity to discuss steps towards sustainable and decentralized community-managed alternative energy, and to open space for clear and people-centered plans for energy governance,” said Saw Tha Phoe, coordinator for Karen River Watch.

The global trend towards renewable energy is also due to increasing awareness worldwide that coal emissions are a primary contributor to climate change and cause devastating impacts to the environment and human health. If Myanmar continues to develop coal power projects, it will miss an opportunity to become a leader in renewable energy, instead sacrificing the health of its communities and the environment. There can be no justification for the continued use of fossil fuels for power generation.

Background on Plant

The New Kosovo power plant is part of the government's plans to reform Kosovo's energy sector. Other plans include closing Kosovo A power station by 2017, rehabilitating Kosovo B power station to meet EU standards, and privatizing the country's electricity distribution system. Plans for New Kosovo also include a lignite coal mine, the Sibovc SW. The World Bank is the main sponsor providing funding for energy sector reforms in Kosovo, including New Kosovo.[1]

The plan to build a new coal plant close to the capital Prishtina has been proposed since the early 2000s. The original proposal was a 2000 MW unit that would export energy, but plans faded due to lack of investors. New Kosovo was later planned to have a capacity of 600 MW, and has been promoted by the US government through the World Bank, which is interested in supporting the project. After Kosovo became a member of the EBRD in December 2012, the bank declared its interest in potentially financing the new plant in its first Kosovo Country Strategy.[2]

On November 23, 2015, Kosovo’s minister of economic development, Blerand Stavileci, announced the latest version of the plant. The new design reduces the size of the plant from 600MW to one 500MW unit.[3] The plant is planned for operation in 2023.[4]

In December 2017 Kosovo authorities signed a contract with US company Contour Global to build the 500 MW unit, at a cost of 1.3 billion euros. Construction is planned to start in late 2018 or early 2019.[5]

In April 2018 ContourGlobal stated that it was seeking to attract a partner for up to a 49 per cent take in the project by the end of 2018 or early 2019. ContourGlobal CEO Joseph Brandt told Reuters that he was confident of securing financing for the project.[6] In its 2018 annual report, the company stated that ""financial close and start of construction is expected late 2018/early 2019.""[7]

In early June 2018 the World Bank said it was reassessing its support for the plant - the only coal power plant project left on its books. The Bank said it was finalising work on a study of the country’s options for rebuilding its power sector, with consideration of the the declining costs of renewables.[8]

In mid-June 2018, ContourGlobal invited tenders for construction,[9] although Kosovo's Energy Secretariat is examining whether elements of the power purchase agreement with ContourGlobal meet the country's requirements that electricity markets be open to competition and non-distorted.[10]

In October 2018 World Bank President Jim Kim said the institution will not move forward with a plan to financially support the Kosovo C coal plant: ""we’re required by our bylaws to go with the lowest-cost option, and renewables have now come below the cost of coal. So without question, we’re not going to do that,” Kim said. Activists said the Bank should help the country fund clean energy.[11] In November 2018 the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) draft strategy ruled out support for coal, including the the Kosovo coal plant.[12]

In May 2019 ContourGlobal said it had chosen a consortium of General Electric subsidiaries to build Kosovo C. The other bidders for the project were China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC), South Korea’s Hyundai, and a consortium of Turkey’s ENKA, Japan’s Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems and Spain’s Tecnicas Reunidas. Construction of the plant is expected to start in late 2019. The project is valued at $1.3 billion, with financing expected to come from a mix of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and export credit agencies, ContourGlobal’s CEO said in October 2018, after the World Bank said it would not finance the plant.[13]

In March 2020 ContourGlobal announced that it was halting its plans to build Kosovo C and, moreover, that it would be making no further coal plant investments. A statement from the company said: ""As a result of the political situation in Kosovo ... our development project is incapable of reaching its milestones prior to the required project completion date"".[14] Dajana Berisha of the Kosovan NGO KOSID which has challenged the Kosovo C plans for many years said: ""This is ultimately proof that the vision and strategy of KOSID, supported by the mobilisation of citizens, media investigations and the exposure of injustices on an international level, has opened new paths for sustainable development in Kosovo.""[15] A CEE Bankwatch Network blog on the decision from CounterGlobal noted that: ""This is excellent news for Kosovo, as it not only frees up resources to concentrate on much-needed energy efficiency, solar and wind investments, but it will also save the country an enormous amount of money.""[16]

History

Plans to update Kosovo's power system began in the early 2000s and originally envisioned a 2,000-MW lignite plant that would allow the country to export energy to its neighbors. Political and investment setbacks caused the plant to be scaled back in size.

A 2010 EU report stated that plans for the development of a new Kosovo power plant (using lignite coal) had been reconfigured: ""The initial installed capacity will be two units of 200-300 MW, the Sibovc lignite field will be developed immediately and participation in the Kosovo B power plant will be included in the package to be offered to investors with a view to refurbishment. The legal unbundling of the distribution and supply functions of the Kosovo Energy Corporation (KEK) is due at the end of 2010 with a view to privatization. Until completion of the new Kosovo power plant project, the other functions will remain integrated in KEK.""[17]

A five-part U.S. State Department strategy for Kosovo obtained by ClimateWire suggested closing Kosovo A, rehabilitating Kosovo B to meet E.U. standards, developing a new 600-MW lignite-fired power plant, and privatizing the country's electricity distribution system.

Role of World Bank

The World Bank is considering supporting the Lignite Power Technical Assistance Project with a World Bank grant of US$10.5 million and a European Commission grant of Euros 2 million, as well as providing ""advisory services"" for the inclusion of private capital in the new lignite mine and power plant.[18]

In a July 2011 statement to ClimateWire, a World Bank spokesman said the institution had not taken a decision on financing Kosovo B, and that an independent panel of experts was being tasked to determine if the project meets the bank's coal guidelines. The World Bank asked for and received written support from the Obama Administration for the World Bank to approve the loan for the new coal plant and privatize the country's electricity distribution system.[19]

In January 2012 a World Bank analysis concluded that building a lignite coal plant in Kosovo could cost nearly twice as much money as previously estimated.

The study also acknowledged about 400 megawatts of hydro, wind and other clean energy capacity in Kosovo -- something the World Bank had previously dismissed as virtually non-existent. Yet despite newly recognized financial challenges to coal and the existence of cleaner alternatives, the World Bank ultimately concluded that a new 600 MW coal power station remained the ""best and cheapest option"" for replacing Kosovo's long-neglected power plants and establishing reliable power supply in the country.[20]

Citizen opposition

Lignite coal lies underneath Hade’s rolling hillsides. Hade lies nine miles outside Pristina. Its coal deposits has made Hade a target as KEK has expanded its mining operations and Kosovo and World Bank officials have planned for the nearby Kosovo C. As of June 2015, the government’s push to clear the village has forced about 1,000 Hade residents from their homes. Thousands more fear displacement. In a complaint filed June 12, 2015, with the World Bank’s internal watchdog, the villagers’ representatives claim the bank has violated its rules governing “involuntary resettlement.” They say the bank allowed the government of Kosovo to take their homes and farmland without fair compensation and without an adequate plan for resettling them.[21]

Environmental groups have also urged the World Bank to allow Dan Kammen, the bank's chief technical specialist for renewable energy, to do a special assessment of Kosovo's options. Kammen did an assessment in Malaysia, which then canceled a proposed coal-fired power plant in favor of alternative energy options. There is a standoff among members of the World Bank's board of directors over a proposal to eliminate coal financing for all middle-income countries. The Obama administration and World Bank officials argue that under the proposed energy strategy, coal lending is permitted for the poorest countries, and Kosovo fits into that category. Environmentalists argue that while the coal plant might meet the letter of the energy strategy, it does not meet the spirit of it, which is to develop cleaner energy sources for developing nations.[22]

Following a World Bank report released in January 2012 that supported the construction the proposed coal-fired power plant in Kosovo, environmental groups maintained that entrenched support for the coal project within the US State Department had obscured thinking about new, cleaner possibilities. The Sierra Club and others argued that the World Bank's analysis showed no near-term need for additional baseload capacity and noted that analysts had not actually calculated all of the costs involved in the plant or addressed Kosovo's needs for peaking power.[20]

Estimated cost of electricity

The Sierra Club analyzed the “Terms of Reference” provided to the Kosovo Strategic Framework for Development and Climate Change Expert Panel on whether the proposed plant meets World Bank policy and determined that it does not, as ""the cost of electricity that would be provided by the Kosovo plant is grossly underestimated"" because ""the predicted cost of electricity is based on the assumption that all four surviving Kosovo units will operate 85 per cent of the time"" yet ""overall demand would [likely] be 20 percent, not 85 percent, thus tripling the cost of generation for this plant."" The report concluded that the plant will likely cost 2-3 times what project proponents claim, and that the country does not have enough base load demand to justify such a large power project.[23]

The World Bank countered in a report stating that the coal plant will cost twice as much as first estimated, but still advocated its construction.[20]

In 2016 a report by IEEFA on the costs if the proposed plant is built found that:[3]

The average Kosovar household would pay 12.9 percent of its annual income for electricity, twice what most European households pay;

Low- to middle-income household in Kosovo would pay 18 percent of its annual income for electricity;

Very low-income households would pay 39.7 percent of their income for electricity; and

Retail electricity costs would increase by 33 to 50 percent.

Environmental Assessment and Bids

An environmental impact assessment is expected to be ready in draft form early 2015, and a board vote on World Bank funding could come by Fall 2015.[22]

In 2014 ContourGlobal, a New York-based international power generation company, submitted the only bid for the Kosovo C project. A 2014 WB memo obtained by ClimateWire stated that U.S. agencies such as the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corp. ""may be an option with a U.S. bidder, but would need some political softening in Washington"" to provide additional funds for the project.[22]

ContourGlobal said it may start building the plant by 2016. As of February 2015 the cost of the project is estimated at up to US$1.6 billion, with a third to be financed by ContourGlobal and the remainder via loans. The plant is planned to go online in 2021.[24]

On November 23, 2015, Kosovo’s minister of economic development, Blerand Stavileci, announced the latest version of the plant. The announcement came in the form of oral remarks. The new design reduces the size of the plant from 600MW to 500MW and is subject to further negotiations. On December 18, 2015, the government of Kosovo, led by Prime Minister Isa Mustafa, announced the signing of a Memorandum of understanding for the project with ContourGlobal. Proposed financing includes a 30 percent equity contribution from ContourGlobal with the remaining 70 percent of financing from outside sources. The final terms of both ContourGlobal’s equity participation and loans from the World Bank and any other lenders are under discussion. The economic development minister states that the technical documents will be completed in the next several months and that construction is to start in late 2016 or early 2017 and will take four to five years to complete.[25]

Cancelled	"Five major operational issues were announced just this month amongst players.

Examples of coal-plant cancellations and stranded-asset realizations are coming thick and fast, according to the Institute of Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), as just this month, India has seen five major announcements:

The state of Uttar Pradesh cancelled bids for 3.8GW of coal-fired power priced at Rs4.16/kWh due to surplus power supply. In an illustration of the rate of change evident across India, these tenders were only raised in September 2016. Essar Power put its 2GW Gujarat power plant in for a debt recast plan, citing unviability of its import-coal-fired power plant.

The state of Gujarat formally cancelled plans for a 4-GW import-coal-fired power plant on the Kathiawar peninsula. 2.3GW of coal-fired power plants in Odisha planned by BGR Energy Systems and Kalinga Energy & Power were cancelled.

A 2,400 MW coal-based power plant proposed by Odisha Thermal Power Corporation Ltd stalled after its coal supply plan fell over as uncompetitive. That followed the cancellation of a 2-GW import-coal-fired power plant by Tata Power in Odisha in January 2017.

Thermal power plants in Gujarat are facing severe coal shortage and are running at less than a day's stocks,"" the official told on condition of anonymity.""If the supply is disrupted, it can lead to the closure of a number of units and create severe capacity shortage,"" he added.The Gujarat State Electricity Corporation (GSECL) is a subsidiary of the Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam (GUVNL), the state power distribution company, and looks after power generation at these station.The power demand in the state is at its peak, with average daily demand touching up to 16,000 MW, due to severe heat wave conditions.The GUVNL, a state government promoted company, has been purchasing on average 3,000 to 4,000 MW through central power agency for meeting the ever increasing demand of power, which is due to shortage of coal, high cost of gas and failure of hydro-based power stations in generating adequate quantity of power, the official said.The state government has requested the railway ministry to provide rakes for transporting coal to the power plants to avoid any shortage of the coal during this peak season, he said.It has also requested the power ministry for granting higher priority to loading of coal for power houses from goods sheds to facilitate higher supply, he added.In a representation made before the Centre, the state government has also requested it to formulate a coal augmentation plan in consultation with the state and supply additional stock to it (Gujarat) from pitheads located in Nagpur in the western region, besides northern and eastern region of the country, the official said."	https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/power/thermal-power-plants-in-gujarat-may-face-closure-on-coal-shortage-gsecl-official/64442596
Cancelled	"Prologue: A tale of two dams

In 2017, I visited 1,200 MW Budhi Gandaki hydropower project, 70 kilometers from Kathmandu, and found many similarities with the Egiin Gol hydropower project in Mongolia, long monitored by our RwB Coalition.

Both projects were designed in the 1970s Soviet-school mega-hydropower planning style, both have not progressed in 40 years. In both cases, the international consultancy Tractebel Engineering proposed to increase dam height and reservoir volume beyond limits considered economically feasible by local experts. In both cases the same main contractor China Gezhouba, was assigned to build the dam without a proper international tender, but the projects were soon stopped due to major changes in decision-making.

Egiin Gol Hydro remains part of the Mongolian government’s plans, but a soft loan from China EximBank approved for the project was later redistributed to seven more sustainable and much needed projects, from a wastewater treatment plant in Ulaan Baatar to higher education programmes.

The Budhi Gandaki contract, cancelled by outgoing government in late 2017, was then reinstalled by new Maoist-led government. However Nepalese experts I spoke to did not believe this dam would be completed in the foreseeable future. Many factors are similar with our experience in Mongolia: prohibitively high costs for a small country, coupled with an uneconomical design; little capability to ensure proper compensation to affected communities; and huge potential impacts on downstream World Heritage sites that will require costly mitigation.

However there is one drastic difference: while the Egiin Gol hydropower project is one of three equally risky options for large hydro in water-scarce Mongolia, the dam on the Budhi Gandaki River is just one of 400 planned hydropower plants for which licenses have been issued to various entities by Nepal. A third of the dams are planned in the Gandaki-Narayani transboundary river basin where there has been no assessment of the cumulative impacts on the ecosystem and local communities, as well as huge implications for management of the transboundary river shared with India.

More dams, more grief?

While abundant water is Nepal’s blessing, haphazard hydropower planning is likely its major curse.

Nepal derives most of its electricity from hydropower and was part of a global study by Benjamin Sovacool and Gotz Walter published at the end of last year, looking at the economic, environmental and social impacts of hydropower. Their statistical analysis supports the “hydroelectric resource curse” hypothesis – arguing that hydropower states have shown significantly worse performance than other nations in dealing with poverty, economic growth, public debt and corruption.

Nepal’s century of painstaking hydropower development, which has resulted in less than 1 GW of installed capacity and significant power deficit, is a lively illustration for this abstract statistical analysis.

There are many signs in Nepal that uncoordinated development of hydropower projects inevitably leads to:

the construction of inferior projects, rather than more efficient designs on the same river;

extreme fragmentation of river basins, decline in fish diversity, encroachment into protected areas and destruction of important wetlands;

encroachment on areas traditionally used by indigenous peoples and marginalised groups, for example, see the report on the Upper Trishuli-1 dam by the Lawyers’ Association for Human Rights of Nepalese Indigenous Peoples.

haphazard mass resettlement (the Budhi Gandaki dam alone will affect 45,000 people);

increased exposure to potential landslides, earthquakes and natural disasters combined with low resilience to climate change impacts;

conflict with other sectors such as agriculture, fisheries, water supply, municipal wastewater, navigation, mining, etc.

financial irregularities, increased corruption and investment schemes with high probability of failure.

So how should Nepal manage its water-blessing to avoid future grief?

Riding the tide of dams

Dam proponents within Nepal have recognised “some problems” in the hydropower sector and are taking belated measures to address them. For example, the Ministry of Forests and Environment issued a new Hydropower EIA Manual in 2018 with support from the International Finance Corporation (IFC). But this only addresses risks of individual hydropower projects. It does not provide any tools for strategic planning and assessing multiple-dam development.

The lack of basin-wide strategic assessments of impacts and opportunities prevents government and businesses from making optimal decisions. This means the power sector has become a major source of environmental problems and social tensions.

(The Nepal government aims to build 10 MW of hydropower for domestic use and 5 MW for export within the next 10 years. Data Source: Department for Energy Development)

Vested interests in Nepal as well as among international donors have thwarted previous attempts to carry out strategic planning. The best attempt – the Japanese International Cooperation Agency’s (JICA) 2014 Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) of the Nationwide Master Plan on Storage type Hydroelectric Power Development in Nepal ­­– was well-meaning, but incomplete and inconsequential.

The most obvious reason for the poor quality SEA was the lack of genuine involvement of civil society and failure to develop an adequate basin-wide strategic assessment framework for energy development. To start with the “analysis of alternatives”, which refuted any other energy source but hydropower, only took up one page of the study.

The SEA failed to assess the cumulative impacts in key basins. “Public consultations” mainly involved personnel of government agencies and excluded environmental advocacy groups and affected communities. No surprise that the assessment report itself documents how during the SEA process the JICA consultants slowly yielded to pressure from energy officials and hydropower experts to downplay social and environmental safeguards.

The failure to assess the country’s optimal energy mix leads to exaggerated expectations of hydropower with little genuine effort to develop solar and wind. The country still has only one 0.68 MW solar farm. Meanwhile hydropower in Nepal is hardly “cheap” energy with typical construction costs in state-supported projects above USD 2000/KW, while the cost of grid-scale solar installation is likely below USD 1000/KW, according to data from the Nepal Energy Development Council.

Problematic consultants in World Bank strategic planning

The World Bank will implement a new Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment (SESA) of water resources management and hydropower masterplans under the framework of the “Nepal Power Sector Reform and Sustainable Hydropower Development (PSRSHD)“. Details of this assessment, which has been delayed for three years due to low priority for the national government, make us anticipate very poor results.

The same contractor has been assigned to do a master plan and then assess its strategic validity – which is a risky business. In the summer of 2018 the contract to prepare both master plans for water resources and hydropower development in each basin of Nepal as well as to conduct SESA of those plans was awarded to a consortium of German Company Lahmeyer (a subsidiary of Tractebel Engineering), China’s Changjiang Institute (CISPDR) and local consultancy TML. CISPDR is the largest institute in China involved in master planning of water resources primarily for hydropower, known internationally as the author of the EIA for the controversial and currently suspended Myitsone hydropower project and associated cascade in Ayeyarawady basin in Myanmar.

Without public oversight, the World Bank and Nepalese government, supported by such consultants, are likely to compromise both integrated river basin planning and the strategic assessment process, reducing it to information selectively compiled in support of accelerated hydropower development with little regard to other uses and natural values of Nepal’s rivers.

And in October 2018 the World Bank, without waiting for the outcomes of this SESA, launched another USD 100 million project ­– “Nepal Energy Sector Development Policy Credit” ­– to improve the financial viability and governance of the electricity sector. However, this again encourages the concentration of energy development efforts solely on hydropower and contains no social and environmental safeguards at strategic level whatsoever. According to the document, the World Bank will not even subject the resulting “Power Sector Strategy and Action Plan for Nepal” to a SEA.

As a result, Nepal agencies will not develop necessary safeguard mechanisms for basin-wide hydropower planning, while Nepal society at large will be deprived of an objective assessment of hydropower development scenarios. Various international financial institutions will continue to invest haphazardly in unsustainable basin schemes and claim their decisions are based on the scientifically-valid SESA approved by government. Investors from China and India will have no safe guidance for their economic and geopolitical competition in the Himalayan river basins.

So far all signs show that this is a disaster in the making.

What could be done to avoid this Catch 22?

Even “objective” strategic environmental and social assessments (SESAs) cannot prevent future conflicts, but it provides all participants with essential knowledge of the tradeoff, potential risks and benefits from a multitude of economic initiatives at the basin level. Therefore it increases the value of carefully designed hydropower and decreases the risks of investment in unsustainable projects that are likely to be stalled.

Despite this, there are still real opportunities for the World Bank projects in Nepal to meaningfully engage the civil society of Nepal, India, China and international NGOs.

This year we saw encouraging examples from elsewhere. The IFC-sponsored SEA of hydropower in Myanmar (2016-2018) included an elaborate stakeholder involvement process, though it has still caused major discontent and protest among ethnic minority groups.

In Mongolia, between 2012-2018 Rivers without Boundaries (RwB) and allies convinced the World Bank to reformat two hydropower feasibility studies in Lake Baikal Basin into a single strategic regional environmental assessment. Previous experience shows that the World Bank Group is responsive to legitimate demands from key constituencies. So it needs CSO advocacy pressure and expertise to ensure it properly implements its own safeguard policies.

The failure of the new World Bank projects in Nepal to carry out necessary strategic environmental planning, gives Nepalese CSOs an additional reason to request extending the SESA into this new strategic process of “improving governance of the electricity sector” where it belongs. The strategic assessment should incorporate analysis of transboundary impacts of projects and provide for consultations with interested agencies and CSO groups from neighbouring countries.

Other important objectives that should be addressed in SESA consultations include:

Mapping biodiversity and ecosystem services in each basin to safeguard priority areas for conservation;

“Risk ranking” of all basin-wide scenarios and specific projects to determine which carry the most social and environmental risks and which will bring the most benefits for local communities;

Strategic measures to mitigate basin-wide impacts on indigenous peoples and other marginalised communities;

Adoption and implementation of basin-wide environmental flow planning and developing national regulatory base for managing e-flows;

Impose limits on resettlement in a given basin/jurisdiction according to capacity to handle this process with quality outcomes;

Genuine analysis of alternatives to assess different energy mix scenarios in terms of true costs, impacts and speed of delivery.

Most of those questions need to be raised, explored and resolved in Nepal anyway, but an official strategic assessment is the most appropriate venue to raise them. The obvious lack of focus on environmental safeguards in World Bank projects should trigger CSO efforts to address those challenges.

Cancelled	"September 15, 2017

China’s CNOOC Ltd and Inpex of Japan have cancelled a liquefied natural gas (LNG) export project planned for Canada’s British Columbia.

The project called Aurora LNG planned for Digsby Island in the Prince Rupert region would have had the capacity to export 24 million tonnes of the chilled fuel per year.

Nexen Energy, the developer of the project and the Canadian a unit of CNOOC, said in a statement on Thursday that the project partners have made the strategic decision to end the Aurora LNG feasibility study and will cease all investigation activity.

Through Nexen, CNOOC owns 60 percent of Aurora LNG. CNOOC acquired Nexen for $15.1 billion back in 2012.

Over the past four years, Aurora LNG has been conducting a feasibility study on liquefying and shipping LNG from the northwest coast of British Columbia to Asian markets, the statement noted.

Through this feasibility study, Aurora LNG “has determined that the current macro-economic environment does not currently support the partners’ vision of developing a large LNG business at the proposed Digby Island site.”

Upstream operations from the project partners’ Horn River natural gas assets in northeast British Columbia will continue, and the partners will also “monitor the North American gas market to evaluate future upstream and downstream investments according to market conditions,” the statement said.

Worth mentioning, there have been more than 20 LNG export projects planned for British Columbia in recent years. However, only Woodfibre LNG has been given the green light by its developers.

Cancelled	"Peruvian environmentalists have welcomed a decision by the country’s Energy Ministry to cancel the development of a hydropower plant in the Amazon basin.

Vice-Minister for Energy Luis Gonzales Talledo announced the decision to terminate a concession for the 1.5 GW Inambari dam on June 13 after reviewing the project and meeting with local communities.

The decision is a blow to Empresa de Generación Eléctrica Amazonas Sur (Egasur), the Brazilian consortium that was to have developed the project, and to the Brazilian government, which wants to tap the hydropower potential of Peru’s Amazon basin.

According to NGO International Rivers, the Inambari dam would flood 410 km2 of forest, including part of the Bahujan Sonene National Park buffer zone, and leave more than 15 000 people without agricultural lands. Flooding 120 km of the recently built Inter-Oceanic Highway would also affect the economic development of the region, says International Rivers.

“Although this resolution does not prevent the construction of all dams in the Inambari Basin, it is very important because it clearly cancels Egasur’s participation,” said Aldo Santos of local NGO SER (Rural Educational Services). “The resolution states that all future proposed projects must be subjected to prior consultation with local communities according to ILO Convention 169 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples, which is an important precedent.”

Last year the Peruvian government signed an energy agreement with Brazil under which Brazil committed to purchase electricity from six dams in the Peruvian Amazon. The second proposed dam under the Brazil-Peru Agreement, the Pakitzapango Dam, was stopped in 2010 by an administrative legal action by the Central Ashaninka del Rio Ene, an indigenous organisation.

The $4.9 billion Inambari Dam was expected to be financed by the Brazilian National Development Bank and was in an advanced stage of planning.

The recently-released Brazil Energy Expansion Plan for 2011-2020 includes a total of 7000 MW of imported hydropower from the Peruvian Amazon.

Australian LNG operator Woodside has canceled plans to build a liquefied natural gas export plant at Grassy Point on Canada’s west coast.

Woodside said it had decided not to renew its sole proponent agreement for the Grassy Point LNG site, which expired on January 15.

“The decision was made after careful consideration of our long-term development strategy in Canada,” a Woodside spokesperson told LNG World News in an emailed statement on Wednesday.

“We are focusing on the Kitimat LNG project in which we are a 50% partner with Chevron (operator),” the spokesperson said.

Woodside planned to build an LNG plant at Grassy Point, located 30 km north of Prince Rupert, on the coast of Canada’s British Columbia.

The first phase of the LNG project was planned to have a capacity of 6-15 million tonnes per annum. The second phase was expected to add additional capacity up to a nominal 20 Mtpa.

There have been more than 20 LNG export projects planned for British Columbia in recent years. However, only Woodfibre LNG has been given the green light by its developers.

Worth mentioning, Chevron is reportedly looking to shed its stake in the Kitimat LNG project at Bish Cove near Kitimat, in British Colombia.

The project, which is a 50/50 joint venture between the Canadian units of Chevron and Woodside, already secured a permit to export 10 million tons of LNG per year for a period of 20 years.

Cancelled	"The exit of Carlos Urzúa as finance minister caused a stir in Mexico, particularly because of his resignation letter, in which he criticized the current administration.

In a statement about his many disagreements on economic issues with other members of the administration, he said some “public policy decisions [were taken] without sufficient justification.” This fueled speculations if he was referring to certain infrastructure projects.

The former minister ended such speculations in an interview with local magazine Proceso, in which he cited the cancellation of the 285bn-peso (US$14.9bn) airport in Texcoco although “works were at a very advanced stage, with too much money involved.”

His remarks fueled the months-long controversy over the cancellation and the proposed three-airport system alternative including an international airport at the Santa Lucía military air base in Mexico state.

At a press conference on Monday, transport and communications minister Javier Jiménez Espriú responded to Urzúa’s criticism and clarified some previous comments.

PROGRESS AND PRICE TAG

Jiménez Espriú argued that construction at Texcoco airport was not that advanced as works had only reached the 20% mark. This figure came from US construction and engineering firm Parsons, which managed the project. It was provided to Jiménez in September and then appeared on the website of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO).

Gerardo Ferrando, director of state holding GACM, told the press conference the project was canceled with only soil compaction works performed at the site where two runways would have been built, and with only the foundations of the terminal building and the inter-modal transfer center being complete. The control tower was reportedly 33% finished.

A lawsuit filed in October by the consortium that was building the terminal – the largest contract awarded for the infrastructure – stated that GACM had failed to provide them with the project’s engineering design. Information about this lawsuit had also been disclosed by Jiménez shortly before AMLO took office in December.

“It was not really known [at the time of the cancellation] how much the project was going to cost or when it was going to be completed,” Jiménez said.

To back up his claim about the unknown price tag, Jiménez cited another Parsons report, submitted to GACM in 2016, which estimated the final cost at US$16.5bn, with operations starting not before 2024.

CANCELLATION REASONS

Although Urzúa acknowledged that some of the land around the mega airport belonged to individuals with ties to the previous government – bolstering the claim that the actual goal for building the airport was to create a giant real estate development in the area – he implied that expropriating that land would have been preferable to impede such business over canceling the airport altogether.

Jiménez Espriú countered that cancellation was never about such alleged corruption. “The argument for the decision was based on technical and financial reasons.”

The minister also claimed some previous comments were misinterpreted. He never said that no corruption could be found. “We have detected many irregularities, but this information has already been submitted to the relevant internal control entities, and to the public administration ministry (SFP) [for review].”

CANCELLATION COSTS

Canceling the mega airport will likely cost 100bn pesos. Overall, 692 contracts, had been awarded, of which 620 are already terminated and 58 are in the process of termination. GACM keeps another 14 contracts, which entail the provision of services.

The 58 contracts still awaiting resolution include the largest ones awarded: for the terminal building and its foundations, the two runways, the control tower, and the inter-modal transfer center.

Although the 692 contracts were worth around 178bn pesos, the works completed by the time the airport was canceled required around 60bn pesos, which the government will pay the contractors, according to the transport and communications ministry (SCT).

The early termination of the contracts will also require the government to pay for the contractor’s recoverable expenses, which the SCT estimates could reach up to 40bn pesos. The exact figure will be known by the end of the month, Jiménez said.

SANTA LUCÍA

Urzúa also criticized the government earmarking significant resources this year for building an international airport at the Santa Lucía military air base. In his view, the project is not ready and the money should have gone elsewhere.

Although Jiménez did not specifically address the former minister’s comment, he said that both the master plan and the airspace design study for the airport have already been completed and that environmental ministry approval of the EIA is impending.

The SCT said the airspace design study has confirmed that maintaining operations at Santa Lucía, Mexico City’s Benito Juárez airport (AICM), and the international facility serving Mexico state’s capital Toluca – the components of the three-airport alternative – is feasible. The results of the study, conducted by Airbus-owned services firm NavBlue, have already been presented to representatives from the International Air Transport Association (IATA), and starting in August will be presented to airline representatives."	https://www.bnamericas.com/en/features/texcoco-airport-cancellation-still-sparks-controversy
Cancelled	"The Ontario power plant scandal (also called the gas plants scandal) relates to the decisions by the Liberal government to cancel the construction of two natural gas power plants: one in Mississauga and another in Oakville. Members of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario (PC) as well as the Ontario New Democratic Party (NDP) also voted to cancel the power plant. The Mississauga cancellation was made as a late campaign promise in the 2011 general election. From immediately following the election until March 18, 2013, the Liberal government stated that the cost of the cancellations was $230 million -- $190 million for the Mississauga plant and $40 million for the Oakville plant. A final report by the Auditor General of Ontario that was released on October 8, 2013 found the total cost of the cancellations was $950 Million ($275 Million for the Mississauga plant[1] and $675 Million for the Oakville plant[2]). This cost included estimates of future costs to the rate payers.

The scandal contributed to the resignation of Premier Dalton McGuinty and Energy Minister Chris Bentley.

Tendering and bidders [ edit ]

In April 2005, the McGuinty Government closed the coal-fired Lakeview Generating Station in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA).[3] This closure created a need to establish new power plants to support the electricity needs of the GTA.

In 2007, the Ontario Power Authority's (OPA) Integrated Power System Plan report recommended new natural gas-fired electric power generation plants (gas plants) be constructed. In August 2008, the Minister of Energy and Infrastructure directed the OPA to competitively procure a combined-cycle gas generation facility in the southwest Greater Toronto Areas with a capacity of up to 850 megawatts (MWs). These plants were to be in operation no later than December 31, 2013. Under this procurement the contractors would continue to own and operate the asset, not just build it as had been typical in the past.[2]

In the May 2009 information to bidders, the OPA stated that the constructors' proposals would need to consider municipal requirements for their proposed sites that were in effect on January 16, 2009.[4] The constructors were responsible for obtaining local permits, not the government. In September 2009, the OPA announced it had accepted a bid by TransCanada Energy (TCE) to build a 900-megawatt natural gas-fired power generation facility in southeast Oakville.[5]

Local opposition [ edit ]

In December 11, 2009, the fast-growing Citizens for Clean Air coalition in Oakville stepped up opposition to the project with campaign slogan: 'It just doesn't make sense.'[5] By June 2010, TCE had missed the contract's milestone dates for obtaining pre-construction approvals and permits from the Town of Oakville.[2]

On October 1, 2010, local opponents rallied at the Ontario legislature and brought in American environmentalist Erin Brockovich to help generate publicity for their fight with the government. Liberal MPP for Oakville Kevin Flynn battled his own government's plan for the gas plant. On October 7, 2010, Liberal energy minister Brad Duguid announced the cancellation of the Oakville gas plant.[6] Ceding to increasing opposition, Duguid proposed to feed the GTA's power demand by improving transmission lines.[2][7]

In the 2011 Provincial election, the Mississauga candidates of all three parties openly expressed opposition to the Mississauga power plant in pre-election debates.[8] NDP candidate Anju Sikka wrote in an open letter to Dalton McGuinty ""An NDP government would never allow construction to begin before a thorough and independent Environmental Assessment has been completed"", and PC candidate Geoff Janoscik stated in a press release ""A Tim Hudak Government will cancel this plant"".[9][10]

Oakville cancellation [ edit ]

On October 9, 2009 the OPA and TCE signed a contract for the Oakville plant. Amid local protest and opposition from the Town of Oakville, in June 2010 TCE missed the milestone date under the contract for obtaining all pre-construction approvals and permits for the Oakville plant from the Town of Oakville.

On October 7, 2010 the Government announced the cancellation of the Oakville plant. The Ministry communique stated that TCE was entitled to reasonable damages and the anticipated financial value of the original contract. On the same day the Minister sent a letter to the OPA advising them of his directive.[2] This commitment to make TCE ""whole"" became central to the massive cost escalation of the project. Minister Kathleen Wynne, later Premier, signed the Cabinet directive.[11]

Mississauga cancellation [ edit ]

On September 28, 2011, a week prior to a general election, the Ontario Liberal Party's campaign announced that if elected, the government would cancel the Mississauga gas plant. Former Premier Kathleen Wynne was co-chair of the Liberal campaign. Editorials questioned the role politics should play in controlling electricity policy.[12]

The election [ edit ]

On October 6, 2011 the Liberals won the most seats in the new legislature but not a majority. The lack of a majority would allow opposition parties to use legislative committees to probe the gas plants scandal. On October 7, 2011 the Minister of Energy announced the Mississauga project had been cancelled by the Cabinet.

Oakville negotiation [ edit ]

The OPA directed to negotiate a settlement with TCE. However, the Premier's direction to guarantee the full financial value of the contract would greatly increase the cost of cancellation. The contract's force majeure clause allowed for cancellation of the contract without costs if the project lagged by more than 24 months due to a failure to obtain municipal permits.[2] TCE had already missed key dates and the Town of Oakville was threatening to fight the project to the Supreme Court of Canada if necessary. These delays might have allowed the government to exit the contract without penalty. Alternatively, another contract clause limited the government's liability to costs paid in the event that the government unilaterally terminated the contract. However, enforcement of the contract was not pursued.

Negotiations took place on the Premier's Office's terms—a commitment to make TCE ""whole."" An initial proposal was developed by TCE to build a replacement power plant in the Kitchener-Waterloo or Cambridge area. A memorandum of understanding on the project was signed. However the MOU expired in June 2011 with no plan adopted.

On August 5, 2011 TCE and the government met to arbitrate the settlement. According to the Auditor-General's report ""as with the Premier’s Office’s commitment to TCE the year before, the [arbitration] framework waived the clause in the Oakville plant contract that gave the OPA a defensible claim of not owing TCE lost profits (that is, the clause stating that only if the Government took discriminatory action through legislation or similar means would the OPA be liable for damages such as loss of profits, with the OPA’s cancellation of the plant not meeting the definition of discriminatory).[2] In March 2012 OPA offered a $462 million settlement to TCE, which was rejected. In April 2012, under Cabinet direction, the OPA offered a settlement of $712 million, which was also rejected.[13] Energy Minister Chris Bentley announced an agreement was reached on August 24, 2012 but still maintained the cost of the cancellation would be $40 million. On Oct 15, 2012, Premier Dalton McGuinty announced he would resign after the selection of a new leader by the Liberal Party. On the same day he prorogued the legislature, shutting down the investigative committees.

Later in October 2012, Premier McGuinty rejected a media report citing research by energy consultant Tom Adams estimating the cancellation costs of the Mississauga and Oakville plants at $1.3 billion. Premier McGuinty continued to claim the cost of cancelling the Oakville plant would be $40 million and Mississauga plant cancellation would cost $190 million -- for a total of $230 million.[14]

The Ontario Liberal party elected MPP Kathleen Wynne as its leader on January 26, 2013. On February 7, 2013, Premier McGuinty requested the Auditor-General review of the costs associated with the cancellation of the Oakville gas plant.[2] Wynne became Premier on Feb 11, 2013.

On March 18, 2013 the Minister of Energy for the first time stated that the $40 million estimate of the cost for cancelling the Oakville plant ""could be wrong.""[14]

Final accounting of costs [ edit ]

On Oct 8, 2013 the Auditor-General reported the cost to cancel the Oakville plant at $675 million. The Auditor-General noted that had the premier's office not become involved, the OPA may have been in a position to simply wait and then exercise an option to break the contract without penalty: ""We believe that the settlement with TCE will not only keep TCE whole, but may make it better than whole,"" Lysyk said. [15] The report estimated the Premier's Office directive to make TCE ""whole"" increased the payout to TCE by $225 million over what was due under the terms of the contract.

A substantial portion of the net $675 million cost of cancelling the Oakville plant and replacing it with the Napanee plant relates to the decision to locate the replacement plant farther from the location of power consumption in the GTA and farther from natural gas supplies. The Auditor General calculated increased gas supply costs and additional line transmission losses totaling of $609 million (included in the $675 million total), which are wholly or partially off-set by a savings of $275 million through a lower negotiated price for the Napanee plant.[2]

Opposition contempt charge [ edit ]

As the questions arose concerning the accuracy of the Liberals' claim that the two gas plant cancellations only cost $230 million, opposition members of the Legislative committee asked new Energy minister Chris Bentley to hand over all documents related to the gas plant cancellations.

On May 16, 2012, the Estimates Committee of the Ontario Legislature adopted a motion directing the former Minister of Energy, the Ministry of Energy and the OPA to produce ""all correspondence, in any form, electronic or otherwise, that occurred between September 1, 2010 and December 31, 2011 related to the cancellation of the Oakville power plant as well all correspondence, in any form, electronic or otherwise, that occurred between August 1, 2011 and December 31, 2011 related to the cancellation of the Mississauga power plant.""

On May 30, 2012, the former Minister of Energy declined to disclose the records requested by the Estimates Committee, citing “the confidential, privileged and highly commercially sensitive nature of the issues.”

On July 13, 2012, 500 pages of emails, letters and PowerPoint presentations were released to the Estimates Committee. Members of the opposition were not satisfied with the 500 pages of documents that were produced

On August 27, 2012, a member of the Estimates Committee sought a ruling from the Speaker on whether privilege had been breached by the failure of the former Minister to provide the documents ordered.

On September 12, 2012, Energy Minister Chris Bentley stated he would comply with the Speaker's order to provide gas plants documents but asked for six weeks more time so as to not jeopardize negotiations with TCE.[16] However, an agreement had been made with TCE on August 24, 2012.

On September 13, 2012, the Speaker found in favour of members of the opposition that there was a prima facie case for contempt by the former Minister and, through the issuance of a Speaker's ruling, ordered the former Minister to comply with the Estimates Committee motion.

On September 21, 2012, Don Guy, the Manager of the Liberals' 2011 campaign, emailed Premier's Office staffer Laura Miller and the brother of the Premier saying the Speaker needs to ""change his mind"" on his ruling. Miller emailed back to Guy stating Premier's Office staffer Dave Gene ""is putting the member from Brant [ie: Levac] on notice we need better here."" [17]

On September 24, 2012, the Liberals release 36,000 documents. On September 25, 2012, the Progressive Conservatives introduce a motion of contempt to the legislature.[5] On October 12, 2012, an additional 20,000 previously undisclosed documents were released by the Liberals. However, not a single document originated from any of the political staff in the office of the Minister of Energy.

Prorogation and Premier McGuinty's resignation [ edit ]

On October 1, 2012, Government House Leader Office (GHLO) staffer David Phillips emailed the Premier's Chief of Staff (Livingston) and Deputy Chief of Staff (Miller) with his ""very rough views/pitch on prorogation."" The email noted the various scandals enveloping the Liberals and being pursued by various legislative committee meetings. ""If we prorogue... these will not take place for the next five months.""[17]

On October 15, 2012, Dalton McGuinty prorogued the legislature and announced his resignation pending a leadership convention.[18]

On October 20, 2012, Liberal government staffers used a media source to present the false-flag story that McGuinty may be quitting to pursue the leadership of the federal Liberal party. Don Guy added that a polling firm included the false McGuinty federal candidacy in a poll to be reported in the media.[17]

New contempt charges [ edit ]

On Thursday, March 7, 2013, the Standing Committee on Justice Policy began their review of the contempt charge against Chris Bentley as well as ""observations and recommendations concerning the tendering, planning, commissioning, cancellation, and relocation of the Mississauga and Oakville gas plants"".[19] Conservative committee members called the Honourable Peter Milliken PC, former federal Speaker of the House of Commons, as a witness. Milliken stated ""This [contempt charge] didn't meet the standards for a contempt motion. I found the (Tories') request at the time reckless,"".[20]

Cover-up discovered [ edit ]

Although 56,500 documents had been tabled from the Ministry of Energy and the OPA to comply with the May 16, 2012 motion of the Estimates Committee of the Legislature, none of the documents came from the political staff in the Minister's Office. The Justice Committee asked the former Chief of Staff Craig MacLennan to give testimony.[citation needed]

At a meeting of Justice Policy Committee of the Legislature on April 9, 2013 NDP MPP Peter Tabuns asked the former Chief of Staff to the Minister of Energy why the political staffer had provided no documents. MacLennan replied: ""I didn’t have any responsive documents. I regret that I didn’t have any responsive documents. My colleague coordinated the search in the office. All I can speak to is what my work habit is, which is to keep a clean inbox. I always have worked that way.""[21]

On April 12, 2013 NDP MPP Peter Tabuns lodged a complaint with the Ontario Privacy Commissioner asking her to investigate ""what appears to be a breach of protocol and a violation of the Archives and Recordkeeping Act and the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act."" [22]

The Privacy Commissioner's report was tabled June 5, 2013. In the report, the Commissioner stated ""While I cannot state with certainty that emails had been deleted improperly by the former Premier’s staff during the transition to the new Premier in an effort to avoid transparency and accountability, it strains credulity that no one knew that the practice of deleting all emails was not in compliance with applicable records management and retention policies."".[23] The report found ""the practice of indiscriminate deletion of all emails sent and received by the former Chief of Staff was in violation of the Archives and Recordkeeping Act, 2006 (ARA) and the records retention schedule developed by Archives of Ontario for ministers’ offices. In my view, this practice also undermined the purposes of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act F(FIPPA), and the transparency and accountability principles that form the foundation of both Acts. It truly strains credulity to think that absolutely no records responsive to the Estimates Committee motion and the Speaker's ruling were retained."" [23]

The Privacy Commission met with information technology staff at the Ministry of Government Services (MGS) to inquire about the possibility of retrieving the deleted emails from MGS's central server. According to Cavourkian's report ""MGS IT staff described the difficulty and complexity of reconstructing data from a search in the email RAID server into a useable file. Specifically, MGS IT staff stated that while searching for a deleted email from yesterday would require a great deal of effort, searching for data from two or three months ago would be “fruitless, as the data no longer exists.” MGS IT staff further stated that reconstructing the data from a search in the RAID server into a usable file would be “tantamount to reconstructing a single shredded document from a bin of shredded documents.” The Commission also found there was ""a culture of avoiding the creation of written documentation on the gas plants issue.""[21]

While probing the appropriateness of the staff of the Minister of Energy, the Commissioner was told Premier McGuinty's Chief of Staff, David Livingston, had asked the Cabinet Secretary about ways to permanently delete emails from computers in the Premier's Office. This fact was included in her June 5, 2013 report and led to the launch of an OPP investigation into the Livingston and the Premier's Office two days later.[21]

On Aug. 20, 2013 Privacy Commissioner Ann Cavoukian said the Wynne government had provided ""inaccurate and incomplete information in my initial investigation"" about the ability to retrieve deleted emails. ""As a direct consequence of the incomplete response, the public has been misled…about the ability of staff to retrieve potentially relevant information.” [24]

On March 27, 2014 a court document became public in which the OPP stated they had probable cause to lay criminal charges against David Livingston, McGuinty's last chief of staff. The document alleged Livingston hired an IT contractor to the Liberal Party, Peter Faist (who was also the common-law partner of the Premier's Office staffer Laura Miller), to wipe clean the hard drives of computers in the Premier's Office that contained information about the gas plant scandal. Police say the hard drives will “afford evidence” of breach of trust. Mr. Faist and Ms. Miller had since moved to British Columbia where Ms. Miller became the Executive Director of the BC Liberal Party. They were scheduled to give evidence to the Justice Policy Committee of the Legislature when an election was called, suspending the activity of the committee.

Criminal trial and conviction [ edit ]

On December 17, 2015 the Ontario Provincial Police announced three criminal charges each against David Livingston and Laura Miller: breach of trust, mischief in relation to data, and misuse of a computer system to commit mischief.[25] Both entered pleas of not guilty as to all counts. The trial was heard by the Ontario Court of Justice at Old City Hall in Toronto, and commenced in September 2017.

At the close of its prosecution on November 3, 2017, the Crown advised that it would not pursue convictions on the breach of trust charges, seeing no reasonable prospect of conviction.[26] The defence subsequently advised that it would not call any witnesses, and applied for a directed verdict of acquittal as to the remaining counts. Justice Timothy R. Lipson ruled against acquittal as to misuse of a computer system to commit mischief, but downgraded the other counts to attempt to commit mischief to data, ruling that: ""...it would be speculative to conclude that data relevant to the prosecution case was destroyed. To draw an inference that the deleted files did, in fact, contain business or work-related material would, at best, amount to an educated guess and that is impermissible."" [27]

Following closing arguments, the Court handed down verdicts on January 19, 2018. David Livingston was found guilty of the remaining counts, mischief in relation to data, and attempted misuse of a computer system to commit mischief. The ruling stated that ""Mr. Livingston's plan to eliminate sensitive and confidential work-related data, in my view, amounted to a 'scorched earth' strategy, where information that could be potentially useful to adversaries, both within and outside of the Liberal Party, would be destroyed."" [28]

Laura Miller was found not guilty on both counts. The Court found that there was evidence suggesting that Ms. Miller was a party to the offences, having been deeply involved in the government's communication strategy with respect to the power plant controversy, and having assisted David Livingston in selecting hard drives to be wiped. However, the Court held that there was reasonable doubt as to her guilt.[28] The Canadian Press reported that Miller's acquittal ""drew an audible gasp"" in the packed courtroom.[29][30][31] A sentencing hearing is scheduled for February 26, 2018.

In response to the verdicts, Premier Wynne's office issued a statement: ""We've been clear from the start that this is not how anyone in government should operate, and it is not how a premier's office should operate... Upon coming into office, we introduced a number of significant measures to strengthen the document retention protocol and ensure that all staff are aware of their responsibilities."" The (then) Opposition leader MPP Patrick Brown stated that ""[t]he guilty verdict is an indictment of the 15 years of Liberal political corruption that has long been rooted in the premier's office."" [31]

Cancelled	"ULAANBAATAR, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Mongolia’s giant Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold mine in the Gobi desert will weigh alternative options in order to guarantee electricity supply over the coming years, it said on Friday, after casting doubt on state plans to build a new power plant in the region.

Oyu Tolgoi, which is run by Anglo-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto, is under pressure to procure power from domestic rather than Chinese sources within the next four years, as stipulated in a 2009 investment agreement.

Mongolia’s energy minister said this week that a power plant due to be constructed at the Tavan Tolgoi coal mine near the Chinese border could help meet the supply gap, if Rio Tinto could guarantee financing for the project.

But the Oyu Tolgoi LLC mining unit said in a statement on Friday that the proposed power plant was unlikely to be completed in time.

According to the original plan, Oyu Tolgoi would be an off-taker rather than owner of the independent power plant located at the Tavan Tolgoi coalfields, but the agreement was cancelled last week, and Rio Tinto said it would work with its partners to find an alternative solution.

However, “extensive negotiations and lender due diligence” would add to the development time, Oyu Tolgoi said, noting that the plant currently lacks a lead investor.

The power station’s “development has been slow due to limited investors and lenders appetite” and it would therefore not be completed within the required period of four years.

Rio Tinto controls 66 percent of Oyu Tolgoi indirectly through its majority ownership of the Toronto-listed Turquoise Hill Resources. The Mongolian government owns the remaining 34 percent.

Oyu Tolgoi said it was now weighing its options, including the possible construction of its own power plant located at the Oyu Tolgoi mine.

“In this context, Oyu Tolgoi will be engaging with the Minister of Energy to ensure the necessary permits and approvals are in place,” it said.

However, the construction costs of a power station would not be included in the $5.3 billion investment for the underground expansion of Oyu Tolgoi, which was approved in 2016, it added.

Cancelled	"NAIROBI, Feb 23 (Reuters) - A $144 million Kenyan wind power project backed by a joint venture between Macquarie Group and Old Mutual Investment Group has been cancelled due to opposition from local landowners and farmers, developer Kinangop Wind Park said on Tuesday.

Kinangop’s 60.8 megawatt (MW) project in Nyandarua County in central Kenya was due to come online by mid-2015 but progress was hobbled by disputes with residents over compensation for land.

Last year, local farmers also opposed the project, saying they would be forced to sell their land. They also said the turbines could cause health problems, which the developer denied.

Kinangop in a statement seen by Reuters on Tuesday said protests by locals had made it difficult for workers to build the wind farm.

“Due to the consequent material delay, project funds have been depleted and the project can no longer be completed by the shareholders,” it said.

The project had aimed to provide electricity to an estimated 150,000 Kenyan homes by 2018.

Its failure is a setback for the East African nation’s drive to increase its power generation capacity by 5,000 MW in the five years to end-2017.

Kenya’s other wind power projects include the 300 MW Lake Turkana Wind Power site in the north of the country.

Kinangop’s main investor is Africa Infrastructure Investment Fund II which is advised by African Infrastructure Investment Managers, a joint venture between Macquarie and Old Mutual.

The rest of the stake is held by Norway’s investment fund for developing countries, Norfund.

Background

Florina power station is a one-unit coal-fired power plant with a total capacity of 330 MW. The supercritical plant is owned by Public Power Corporation S.A. and began operation in 2003. It is powered by lignite coal.[1][2]

Expansion

A second unit of 440 MW has been proposed, with an estimated operation date of 2021.[3][4]

In April 2014 a bill was submitted to spin off and partially privatize PPC under a plan agreed to with the country’s EU/IMF lenders. According to the plan, 30% of PPC’s units and mines would be transferred to the new company, including Meliti I and the license for Meliti II.[5] However in February 2015 the new Greek government said it would not privatize PPC.[6]

In February 2016, PPC said it will seek to develop Meliti II as a joint venture with a European partner, who would together construct the plant and operate it as well as the region’s coal mines. The prospective plant has a budget of 750 million euros.[7] However, according to CAN Europe, while the proposal has a production permit there has been no discussion on an environmental permit, and the project is effectively on hold while PPC focuses on Ptolemaida V Power Station.[8]

In August 2016 PPC announced that it will sign an MoU with China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) for the construction of a second lignite-fired unit at its Meliti station. PPC estimates the new unit will cost 700 million euros, while investments in a nearby lignite pit to mine coal for the unit would raise the total investment to more than one billion euros.[9] The MoU for a 450 MW unit was signed in September 2016. PPC is believed to be open to the prospect of becoming a junior partner with CMEC in this venture.[10]

However, in April 2017 it was reported that China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) ""appears to have decided to put on hold the prospect of developing and acquiring majority control of Meliti II,"" due to concerns over reliability of mining and plant ownership rights.[11]

On April 6, 2018, the environmental permit for Meliti II was renewed, along with the permit renewal of the existing unit Meliti I. The new permit will be valid until 2028.[12]

WWF Greece, Greenpeace Greece, and ClientEarth are seeking to annul the environmental permit for Meliti I and II, saying the Greek state granted the new permit despite no new EIA having been conducted since the original one expired in 2009, before updated regulations were implemented, and without consideration of climate change. The court date for this case is March 2019.[13]

In September 2019 the government of Greece said it planned to phase out coal power by 2028, making Meliti II look unlikely, although a formal cancellation has not been announced.[14]

In January 2020 Greece’s Supreme Administrative Court, the Greek Council of State, annulled the environmental permits for the Meliti plant. The decision means that the construction of Meliti II will no longer go ahead, while Meliti I will need to apply for a new environmental permit if it is to continue operating.[15]

Ownership

In April 2018 Greece agreed with its lenders to sell 40 percent of the coal-fired capacity of PPC, which is majority state-controlled. The 330 MW Meliti Power Station and the license for the second 450 MW unit will be sold, along with two units in southern Greece. Under bailout terms, PPC should launch an international tender for a buyer at the end of May 2018.[16]

The 2 GW Ordos project, planned for construction near Ordos City, Inner Mongolia by the Chinese government and US-based solar developer First Solar, has been taken off the table after over four years of negotiation failed to produce agreement on a price for its power, which would have been sold to China’s grid.

A spokesman for First Solar said the cancellation was “due to the market environment”.

China and First Solar signed a memorandum of understanding (pictured) in 2009, which included the potential for First Solar to open a manufacturing plant in Inner Mongolia. At the time, construction on the 30-MW first phase of the project was expected to begin in early 2010, with phases two (100 MW) and three (870 MW) planned for 2014, and phase four (1 GW) for 2019.

Cancelled	"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia’s economics minister said on Saturday the country will cancel its $20 billion East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) project with contractor China Communications Construction Co Ltd (CCCC).

Mohamed Azmin Ali said at a media event that the project’s cost was too great, while also giving an assurance that Malaysia would welcome investment from China on a case by case basis.

“The cabinet has made this decision because the cost to develop the ECRL is too big and we don’t have (the) financial capacity,” said Azmin.

The government was still determining how much to pay CCCC for the project cancellation fee, he said.

The interest on the project alone amounted to half a billion ringgit ($120 million) a year.

“We cannot afford to bear this, so this project needs to be terminated without affecting our good relationship with China.”

Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said last August that the rail project would be canceled “for now”, but the government has since said it was in negotiations with CCCC on the rail line’s future.

He also announced in August the cancellation of another China-backed project, a natural gas pipeline in the East Malaysia state of Sabah.

CCCC did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters by phone and text message.

Since coming into power last May, Mahathir has repeatedly vowed to renegotiate or cancel what he calls “unfair” Chinese infrastructure deals authorized by his predecessor Najib Razak, whose near-decade long rule ended in electoral defeat amid a massive financial scandal.

The ECRL project was the centerpiece of China’s infrastructure push in Malaysia but work had been suspended pending discussions over pricing and graft accusations.

Malaysia’s finance minister said last year that the cost of the ECRL project had been inflated, according to local financial newspaper The Edge.

The ECRL project is one of the biggest China has signed under its signature Belt and Road initiative, as well as one of state-owned contractor CCCC’s largest railway projects.

In November, the U.S. China Economic and Security Review Commission issued a report ranking the ECRL as the second-largest Belt and Road project by estimated cost, behind the $21.4 billion Moscow-Kazan high-speed railway project in Russia."	https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-malaysia/malaysia-to-cancel-20-billion-china-backed-rail-project-minister-idUSKCN1PK03P

Ostroleka C is now being considered to be built as a gas-fired facility.

The anti-coal European Union (EU) climate policy as well as a shift in European Investment Bank financing policies, however, forced development partners Energa and Enea to suspend financing for the coal-fired project in February 2020.

Ostroleka C is a 1GW ultra-supercritical coal-fired power project under construction at Ostroleka, in north-east Poland. It was expected to be the last coal power plant to be built in Poland.

GE Power was contracted to build the 1,000MW Ostroleka C coal-fired power plant in Poland. Image courtesy of General Electric.

The engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contract for the plant was signed in July 2018.

Construction works on the £1.24bn ($1.6bn) project were started in October 2018.

Scheduled to commence operation in 2023, the Ostroleka C power plant was expected to produce 7,200GWh of electricity a year, which would have been enough to power 300,000 Polish homes.

Ostroleka C power project development history

In 2009, Energa, the owner and operator of Ostroleka A and Ostroleka B power plants, established ElektrowniaOstroleka to build the 1,000MW Ostroleka C power plant and started preparatory works with the aim of bringing the new plant into operation by 2012.

The project was, however, canceled in late-2012, due to lack of financing.

The Ostroleka C project development kick-started in the second half of 2016 after Energa and Enea entered a joint investment agreement for the project, with Enea buying 50% interest in ElektrowniaOstroleka.

The coal power project received permits from the Polish government in July 2016.

Controversy over Ostroleka C

Although construction has already started, Energa and Enea have not able to secure full financing for the project, as banks have refrained from supporting coal-fired projects for environmental and sustainability reasons.

Energa and Enea suspended financing to freeze construction works on the coal-based power project in February 2020.

The Ostroleka C project has been criticised by environmental activists as well as investors who have questioned its economic viability in the face of rising carbon emission costs.

Poland's state-run oil farm PKN Orlen, which announced plans to take over Energa in December 2019, has hinted its intention to replace coal with natural gas as a fuel source for Ostroleka C.

If built as a gas-fired facility, the Ostroleka C project completion is expected to be delayed beyond 2023.

Ostroleka C power plant make-up

Located on a site adjacent to Ostroleka A and B power plants on the border of the Rzekuń Commune and the City of Ostroleka, the 1,000MW power plant was planned to be equipped with an ultra-supercritical boiler and a steam turbine generator supplied by GE.

The plant was to use hard coal as primary fuel and biomass as secondary fuel.

Ostroleka C would have a closed cooling system consisting of cooling towers using water from the Narew River for cooling.

With net power efficiency exceeding 46%, Ostroleka C was planned to be one of the most efficient thermal power plants in Poland.

The plant was also planned be fitted with all necessary emission control equipment to meet the European Union’s (EU) strict emission standards applicable for large combustion plants (LCPs).

Coal supply for Ostroleka C

Ostroleka C power plant was to be supplied with coal from Bogdanka coal mines located in the Lublin Coal Basin, approximately 273.4km away from the project site, under long-term coal supply agreements with PolskaGrupaGórnicza (PPG) and LubelskiWęglemBogdanka. Enea owns a majority stake in Bogdanka mines.

PPG agreed to supply up to two million tonnes of coal a year for Ostroleka C and one million tonne of coal a year for Ostroleka B, under a long-term agreement signed in 2016.

Power transmission from Ostroleka C

The electricity generated by the power plant was to be evacuated by the state-owned transmission company PolskieSieciElektroenergetyczne Operator (PSE) via 400kV transmission lines connected the GrudziądzWęgrowo substation.

Contractors involved

GE Power signed the EPC for the Ostroleka C power plant in July 2018. The company was to design and build the power plant as well as provide the boiler and turbine generator, under the contract agreement.

Polimex-Mostostal, an engineering and construction company based in Poland, was selected as the subcontractor by GE Power for the plant construction as well as for the delivery and assembly of steel structures for the Ostroleka C project, in June 2018.

PHB Weserhütte, a subsidiary of Spanish engineering firm TSK Group, was subcontracted by GE Power for the EPC of material handling and storage systems of the Ostroleka C project in June 2019.

Mostostal Warszawa was awarded a £130m (PLN 609m) contract by GE Power for the construction of coal handling facilities, ancillary units, roads, as well as partial construction of the main building in August 2019.

A consortium of Torpol and Zakłady Automatyki KOMBUD was awarded a £36.5m (PLN 178.8 m) contract by ElektrowniaOstroleka for the reconstruction of the railway infrastructure related to the Ostroleka C power project in October 2019.

Ostroleka A and B plant details

Ostroleka A coal-fired power plant, built in 1956 with an initial installed capacity of 78MW and later upgraded to 390MW, was decommissioned in 2014.

Ostroleka B, comprising three 200MW coal-fired generating units, was commissioned in 1972. The power plant has been undergoing a comprehensive modernisation programme since 2015.

The modernisation programme involved the replacement of three OP-650 boiler units supplied by Rafako and the refurbishment of turbine generator units, to increase the total generating capacity of the plant to 681MW, while decreasing Knox emissions.

Further, the switchgears and transformers were refurbished and the flue-gas desulfurisation (FGD) technology was installed.

A contract agreement was signed with Rafako and Energy SerwisSpolka to construct the second FGD unit for Ostroleka B, in July 2018."	https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/projects/ostroleka-c-power-plant-poland/
Cancelled	"* Tensions running high over tax bill

* Rio Tinto, Turquoise Hill say are assessing options

By Terrence Edwards

ULAANBAATAR, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Mongolia can build a power plant at its Tavan Tolgoi coal mine by 2021 to supply the Oyu Tolgoi copper project, energy officials said on Tuesday, as the government seeks to hold Rio Tinto to an agreement to use Mongolian power.

Tensions have mounted between the Mongolian government and its fellow shareholders in Oyu Tolgoi, where Rio Tinto is operating a huge underground extension.

Last week, Rio Tinto said it was working with its partners to find a solution after the government announced the cancellation of a contract, which Rio interpreted as meaning the Tavan Tolgoi power project was no longer viable.

Mongolia’s Energy Minister Tserenpil Davaasuren said on Tuesday a cooperation agreement with a party called South Gobi Energy had been cancelled, but a plant at the Tavan Tolgoi coal mine was still in development.

Oyu Tolgoi had “the responsibility to choose total energy demand for Oyu Tolgoi from Mongolia within four years,” he said.

D. Batbileg, director of the Tavantolgoi Power Plant Project, addressing the same news conference said construction work was “ready to begin”.

Local media reported the government was seeking guarantees from Rio Tinto before going ahead.

Rio Tinto was not immediately available to comment. Its statement last week said it was working on all options, including the construction of a power plant at Oyu Tolgoi whose cost would be finalised between shareholders.

The mine is jointly owned by the government of Mongolia, with 34 percent, and Turquoise Hill Resources with 66 percent. Turquoise Hill is in turn 51 percent-owned by Rio Tinto.

Turquoise Hill also said it was evaluating its options.

“A final decision on the outcome, cost or financing of a permanent domestic power supply has not been concluded at this time,” an emailed statement said.

Tensions over tax and benefits to the country held up an expansion project for underground mining to tap into most of the resource in 2013. Construction resumed after May 2015, when the parties signed a new agreement.

But the international partners are again at odds with the government following a claim from the Mongolian Tax Authority for an additional $155 million for the years 2013 through 2015.

Cancelled	"KUALA LUMPUR - Malaysia is seeking a new contractor to build the East Coast Railway Link (ECRL), after terminating the original contract awarded to China Communications Construction Company (CCCC) on Tuesday (Jan 22), a source told The Straits Times.

It is understood that the government is seeking to halve the estimated project cost of RM81 billion (S$27 billion) to RM40 billion.

Work on the 688km railway line linking the east and west coasts of Peninsular Malaysia has been suspended since last July, as part of the new Pakatan Harapan administration's review of large-scale infrastructure projects after the coalition won the elections in May.

Negotiations to reduce the project cost - initially pegged at RM55 billion when the plans were launched in November 2016 - have continued with CCCC since then, with government adviser Daim Zainuddin leading the talks.

The Straits Times understands that the government laid down a maximum cost of RM40 billion and asked for more local products and services be included in the works. However, CCCC could not meet these requirements, resulting in negotiations coming to an end.

CCCC did not respond to a request for comment.

Tun Daim told reporters on Tuesday that the railway project is still on, with negotiations still ongoing. He did not elaborate who the ongoing negotiations were with.

Related Story Pause on Malaysia's East Coast Rail Link plan deflates local dreams

CCCC was originally awarded the engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning contract for the ECRL, which was to be funded by Malaysia taking a soft loan from Export and Import Bank of China (Exim) to cover 85 per cent of the cost. The remaining sum was to be raised from local bond issues.

The ECRL was among a handful of China-funded mega infrastructure projects entered into by the previous Barisan Nasional government that was scrutinised by the new administration in a bid to tackle state debts totalling over RM1 trillion.

Two pipeline projects with China costing RM9.4 billion were cancelled after the government found that only 13 per cent of the works had been completed despite nearly 90 per cent of the project sum being paid out.

Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad had described the ECRL contract as ""strange"" in an interview last July.

""That contract is strange,"" Tun Dr Mahathir told business paper The Edge. ""The contractor must be from China and the lending is from China. And the money is not supposed to come here but (kept abroad) to pay the contractor in China,"" the paper quoted him as saying.

Touted as a game-changer when it was first launched, the ECRL was meant to be a land bridge linking Kuantan Port with Port Klang that would allow shipped cargo to bypass Singapore.

Construction sites along the 12-passenger station route have been left abandoned since the stop-work order was issued in July."	https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/malaysia-cancels-deal-with-china-company-seeks-new-contractor-for-east-coast-rail-link

Cancelled	"The president of a company developing two new natural gas-fired power plants in Ohio said he is ending a project for a third plant there after lawmakers passed legislation to help two struggling nuclear generation facilities in the state.

Bill Siderewicz, who leads Massachusetts-based Clean Energy Future LLC, on August 20 in a statement said the passage of House Bill 6 (HB 6) is “political tampering with Ohio’s free electricity generation markets,” and said it would hurt investment in new power generation projects in the state.

Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, signed the bill into law July 23. The legislation, supported mostly by the state’s GOP lawmakers, earmarks $150 million annually through 2026 to provide financial help to FirstEnergy Solutions’ (FES) 908-MW Davis-Besse nuclear plant near Toledo, and FES’s 1,268-MW Perry plant northeast of Cleveland. The new law also scales back and eventually ends requirements for utilities to generate more solar and wind power in the state.

FES had said it would close the nuclear plants over the next two years absent financial support. The company earlier this month said it would close the coal-fired Bruce Mansfield plant in Pennsylvania in November, two years ahead of schedule.

Law Also Will Help Coal Plant

FES on July 26, just days after the new law was signed, also said it was canceling its plan to close the W.H. Sammis coal-fired power plant in eastern Ohio. FES had said it would close the 2,200-MW plant at Stratton, near the Pennsylvania border, in 2022, but said the money to support the nuclear plants also would allow it to continue operating Sammis.

FES CEO John Judge, speaking at a public forum in Steubenville, Ohio, in June, prior to the passage of the legislation, said, “House Bill 6 is really designed to help our nuclear plants and all the money from that that came to us would go to those nuclear plants, but at the same time it would make our company economically healthy enough that we would be able to look at other investments like investing in the Sammis plant.”

FES filed for bankruptcy in March 2018. The company had earlier said it would close both nuclear plants, which have been uneconomic for several years, by the end of 2021 unless Ohio officials provided financial assistance to keep the plants in operation. Four other states—New York, New Jersey, Illinois, and Connecticut—also in recent years enacted programs to subsidize nuclear power generation.

Clean Energy Future developed the 940-MW natural gas-fired Lordstown Energy Center, which entered commercial operation last year, and also is set to begin construction this year on the nearby gas-fired Trumbull Energy Center. Siderewicz on Tuesday said his group would end its plan for a third plant in that area, called Lordstown-3, though he said almost $1 million has already been spent on development and permitting for the facility.

“Over the past six years, I have come to know and appreciate the strong will and moral fiber of those who call the [Mahoning] Valley home, and today I find it deeply painful not to be able to help boost the region’s growth due to political forces that exist in Columbus,” Siderewicz said in the release. “Political tampering with Ohio’s free electricity generation markets has very real impacts and results, as we see happening now.” Siderewicz said the project would have created about 1,100 union construction jobs, with a $29 billion economic impact to the Mahoning Valley region over the next 50 years.

General Motors earlier this year closed a production plant in Lordstown, putting 1,700 employees out of work. The plant had downsized in recent years; it had as many as 4,500 workers as recently as 2016.

Law Cuts Mandates for Renewables

Supporters of HB 6 said the nuclear plants account for nearly all of Ohio’s clean power generation. The two plants employ about 1,400 workers. The bill’s backers also said eliminating existing mandates to increase investment in renewable energy would result in lower electricity bills, even with the new surcharge for the nuclear plants.

Dan Sawmiller, the Ohio energy policy director the Natural Resources Defense Council, called HB 6 “one of the worst pieces of energy-related legislation we’ve seen.”

The final version of HB 6 calls for residential power customers to pay a surcharge of 85 cents per month to support the nuclear plants, according to the Warren (Ohio) Tribune Chronicle. Major industrial facilities will pay $2,400 monthly. The bill was designed to prop up the nuclear plants, but about $20 million annually will go to large-scale solar projects that have already been approved. The legislation also allows for monthly surcharges on all bills to support the Sammis plant, and a second coal-fired plant in Indiana.

Siderewicz in a statement said the bill is a “classic case of ‘Ohio Main Street bailing out Wall Street’.”

Siderewicz testified before Ohio lawmakers against the bill in April, warning it would take investment in power generation away from Ohio. He said that is now happening, pointing to Clean Energy ending development of Lordstown-3, and LS Power’s decision to back away from a $500 million expansion of its 700-MW gas-fired Troy Generating Facility in Luckey, Ohio. LS Power had planned to add another 500 MW of generation capacity to the plant.

Ohio, with the state’s ability to source gas from the Utica and Marcellus shale plays, has been a hub of activity for new gas-fired power plants. Carroll County Energy, a 700-MW plant near Carrollton, Ohio, came online in December 2017, a few months after the 870-MW Oregon Energy Center near Toledo began operating. The 475-MW Middletown Energy Center north of Cincinnati came online in May 2018.

Construction of the $1.3 billion, 1,182-MW South Field Energy plant near Wellsville in Columbiana County, began in May of this year. The plant is scheduled to come online in mid-2021.

Mexican news outlet Aristegui Noticias reported on Tuesday that officials gave Chinese representatives 11 months’ notice about a contract to build a train project linking Mexico City with the wealthy, industrial city of Queretaro, citing a letter from China Railway Construction Corporation (CRCC) (601186.SS).

The report details a 2014 meeting between Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray, who was then finance minister, and Chinese officials to discuss cooperation between the countries, which took place 10 days before the international tender launched.

In a statement issued on Wednesday, the Foreign Ministry stressed the meeting between Videgaray and Chinese officials was publicized and touched on a wide range of projects, including the Mexico-Queretaro railway, which was already public.

“At all times, it was made clear to Chinese officials that the projects would be realized through public tenders,” the ministry said, adding that efforts to promote ties between the countries via a working group were “announced in an open and transparent fashion.”

However, questions were raised after 16 firms - including Siemens (SIEGn.DE), Bombardier (BBDb.TO) and Mitsubishi (8058.T) - withdrew from the rail tender, leaving a consortium led by state-controlled CRCC as the de facto winner, Reuters reported.

Around that time, it also emerged that Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto’s wife was buying a home from a Mexican firm that was part of the Chinese-led consortium, touching off a political firestorm.

Videgaray’s participation in the working group was not mentioned in a Mexican government auditor’s report, which found that Videgaray and Pena Nieto had not benefited or tried to influence officials responsible for awarding contracts, according to Aristegui Noticias.

The group in which Videgaray participated has yielded other successful collaborations between the nations, such as a Mexico-China investment fund, the foreign ministry said."	https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-mexico/mexico-denies-favoring-chinese-consortium-in-railway-bidding-idUSKBN1FS0P5
Cancelled	"Poland seeks alternatives for last coal thermal power plant project

The European Green Deal and the European Investment Bank’s exit from fossil fuel projects prompted the suspension after 5% of the unit was completed. Two government-controlled enterprises have legal challenges and are burdened with emission expenses. Coal is now less likely to be used in thermal power plant Ostrołęka C if works continue.

State-owned electricity producers are reportedly negotiating with General Electric Co. about the possibility to fuel a power plant under construction with gas instead of hard coal. The Ostrołęka C unit in northeastern Poland is projected for 1 GW and budgeted at EUR 1.4 billion. The project has just been suspended and officials cited the lack of funding sources and changes in European Union’s policy and strategy for coal and thermal power plants.

The development of the new unit was halted already in 2012, but the government restarted it in 2016. The review will be finished by May 7, said Energa SA, which leads the last remaining project to burn coal in Poland. The contract with GE provides the possibility of a suspension of up to three months.

The review will be finished by May 7, Energa said

Enea SA is Energa’s partner in Ostrołęka C. Environmentalists from ClientEarth, a shareholder, managed in August to get the board’s decision to authorize the project declared invalid in court. Then, in November, Enea was told to disclose documents on feasibility, which the firm from Poznań failed to before the freeze.

The ongoing revision is comprehensive, Energa said and noted it is working on technical, technological, economic, organizational, legal and financial aspects. The suspension was declared following the adoption of the European Green Deal and the change in the European Investment Bank’s rules on lending.

The European Green Deal and the change in the European Investment Bank’s rules on lending have led to a financing squeeze

Another important factor is the Polski Koncern Naftowy Orlen SA’s attempt to take over Energa. The company has said it is against using coal for Ostrołęka C. The refiner also known as PKN Orlen revealed it would consider natural gas.

Deputy prime minister Jacek Sasin, also in charge of state assets, claimed there is no doubt the thermal power plant would be built, but that the question is on which fuel it would run.

The unit is 5% finished. Energa and Enea are at risk of cancellation fees for contractors and other expenses. Ostrołęka C may need subsidies to continue in the original form due to the burden of the EU’s emissions certificates.

The coal sector in Europe is struggling with costs of emissions certificates

Poland excluded itself from the bloc’s latest environmental pledge. The share of coal in its power system is three quarters. The country has almost 140,000 workers in the coal sector and the change in overall conditions is starting to take its toll.

Of note, Greece’s PPC is reviewing its plans for Ptolemaida 5. The lignite-fired thermal power plant should be finished by September and the state said it would phase out coal by 2028. Officials said they are considering a switch to gas down the road or even biomass and waste or a combination of fuels.

The power plant’s 610 MW should be built for EUR 1.5 billion. The utility asked Mitsubishi-Hitachi to produce a study about the alternatives.

Cancelled	"The last coal plant under construction in Poland could face cancellation after it has had financing suspended.

Polish energy companies Enea SA and Energa SA have announced they have halted financing for the 1GW Ostrołęka C facility due to shifting economic and political contexts.

A statement released by the firms referred to changes “in a number of circumstances” such as “planned changes in the EU’s policy with regard to the electricity sector” and the “so-called Green Deal, an action plan to ensure EU climate neutrality by 2050”.

Coal generation is on a downward trajectory across Europe and many people now believe continuing to build coal power plants risks leaving workers and assets stranded as the economy drives towards decarbonisation.

Michal Hetmanski from Warsaw-based think tank Instrat said: “Rising carbon prices are leaving existing coal power plants with financial trouble. Building new coal with the hope that annual profits would cover CAPEX was highly unrealistic and this has finally sunk in for Energa and Enea.

“We’ve shown that the companies would have been looking at a loss of €1.5 billion (£1.25bn) over 30 years for Ostrołęka C – almost the entire value of the investment to build the plant in the first place.”"	https://www.energylivenews.com/2020/02/14/under-construction-coal-plant-in-poland-has-financing-suspended/
Cancelled	"The decision last week of Polish state-run utilities Energa and Enea to freeze financing for their joint project to build a new 1GW coal-fired power unit at Ostrołęka, north east of Warsaw, could mark a key change in Poland’s energy policy.

The two companies said that they were suspending financing of the project, which is valued at around six billion zloty (1.41 billion euros), due to difficulties in raising investment capital as well as EU climate policy and new European Investment Bank (EIB) financing policies.

They also said a further analysis of technical and economic parameters is necessary.

“Efforts to acquire an investor for the project have not brought the expected results,” the two utilities said in statement. While construction is expected to continue for the time being, the two companies said that they could not rule out suspending work on the plant, which is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2023.

For years, the Poland’s ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) has defended its coal industry against objections from environmental groups – as well as the EU.

It was PiS which revived the long-dormant Ostrołęka C project in 2016 after winning an election the year before on a pledge to sustain Polish coal mining.

The first sign of a possible shift in policy came last November when the country’s prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki created a new climate ministry and installed as its head not a member of his own pro-coal party but a technocrat, Michał Kurtyka, the former president of the United Nation’s COP24 climate talks.

Part of the reason is that Poland could be in line to receive more than a quarter of the European Union’s Just Transition Mechanism funds, part of the new European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen’s European Green Deal.

The total amount Poland could receive is around 27 billion euros, but in order to do so it needs to commit to de-carbonising its economy. Coal currently accounts for around 80 per cent of the country’s electricity.

In December however, Poland refused to join the rest of the EU’s member states in agreeing to make the bloc carbon neutral by 2050, arguing that it will need more time.

Ostrołęka C – purported to be the last coal-fired power station Poland will build – has long been fiercely opposed by environmentalists who say it would deepen Poland’s reliance on coal and is not economically justifiable. They have welcomed and Enea and Energa’s decision.

“The reality that there is no future for old coal, let alone new coal, in Europe is finally dawning on Poland’s energy sector,” says Zala Primc, a campaigner at the NGO Europe Beyond Coal. “It’s been clear for years that Ostrołęka C is a losing bet financially. Cancelling the project now in favour of a switch to clean, renewable energy will reverse Energa and Enea’s declining fortunes while protecting the health of Polish people, and our climate.”

Other environmentalists have also suggested that the project should now be cancelled.

“While it is positive that Energa and Enea have cancelled financing for Ostrołęka C, banks such as Santander and BNP Paribas should also rule out financial support for Energa and Enea until the coal plant is cancelled once and for all,” says Kuba Gogolewski, senior finance campaigner at Fundacja Rozwój TAK – Odkrywki NIE.

“Poland’s PZU, currently the lead insurer for the project, should use this opportunity to announce an end to its support for new coal project underwriting, and end coal investments overall without exception. Talanx and other insurers should also take note and close the Polish loophole in their coal insurance policies.”

Under EU emissions regulations, Ostrołęka C’s owners would need to pay dozens of euros per ton of carbon emitted into the atmosphere as a byproduct of burning coal. Only heavy government subsidies would make it viable.

“Rising CO2 prices are leaving existing coal power plants with financial trouble. Building new coal with the hope that annual profits would cover capex was highly unrealistic, and this has finally sunk in for Energa and Enea,” says Michal Hetmanski of Instrat, a Warsaw-based energy and economics think tank. “We’ve shown that the companies would have been looking at a loss of 1.5 billion euros over 30 years for Ostrołęka C – almost the entire value of the investment to build the plant in the first place.”"	https://emerging-europe.com/news/has-poland-already-built-its-last-coal-fired-power-plant/

Cancelled	"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration said on Thursday it was formally cancelling $929 million in previously awarded funding for California’s high-speed rail program after rejecting an appeal by the state.

The U.S. railway regulator, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), said on Thursday it had canceled the funding awarded in a 2010 agreement after it said the state had “repeatedly failed to comply” and “failed to make reasonable progress on the project.”

In a statement, the FRA said it was still considering “all options” on seeking the return of $2.5 billion in federal funds the state has already received.

The decision is the latest salvo in an ongoing battle between the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and California over a series of issues including immigration, vehicle emissions standards and internet policy.

The largest U.S. state has repeatedly sued the Trump administration and officials expect the state will sue over the rescinding of rail funding.

The Trump administration moved to end funding after California Governor Gavin Newsom said in February the state would scale back the planned $77.3 billion high-speed rail project after cost hikes, delays and management concerns, but would finish a smaller section.

In a statement on Thursday, Newsom called the action “illegal and a direct assault on California, our green infrastructure, and the thousands of Central Valley workers who are building this project.”

He added “the Trump Administration is trying to exact political retribution on our state,” and vowed to go to court to protect “California’s money, appropriated by Congress.”

The traffic-choked state had planned to build a 520-mile (837-km) system in the first phase that would allow trains to travel at up to 220 miles per hour (354 kph) from Los Angeles to San Francisco and begin full operations by 2033.

Newsom said in February the state would instead complete a 119-mile high-speed link between Merced and Bakersfield in the state’s Central Valley.

U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, who overseas FRA, in February said California’s drastically scaled back rail project “is a classic example of bait and switch... We have a right to ask for that $2.5 billion back as well.”

The state said in March that ending funding “would cause massive disruption, dislocation, and waste, damaging the region and endangering the future of high-speed rail in California.”

The Obama administration awarded California $3.5 billion in 2010 and California voters in 2008 approved nearly $10 billion in bond proceeds.

In March 2018, the state forecast project costs had jumped $13 billion to $77 billion and warned costs could be as much as $98.1 billion."	https://www.reuters.com/article/us-california-rail/u-s-cancels-929-million-in-california-high-speed-rail-funds-after-appeal-rejected-idUSKCN1SM2F9

State owned electric power generation company Botswana Power (BPC) has announced the cancellation of a tender to build and operate a 100MW solar power plant, for which it was seeking private investor partners.

BPC intends to re-issue the tender in order to engage an independent power producer (IPP) who can develop the solar project under a private undertaking.

In a statement, BPC said: “The project which was initially structured as a joint venture between BPC and private producers will now be implemented through independent power producers, meaning it will be 100% privately owned.

“A new tender is anticipated to be floated by end of June 2019.”

The tender for the solar power plant in the country had received 166 bids from both local and international power producers.



Some of the bidders who participated in the bidding process, included Africa Clean Energy Solutions, Changhong Research Labs and Steag Energy Services.

“A new tender is anticipated to be floated by end of June 2019.”

The tender was issued by the state-owned power distributor in order to meet the growing power demand, which according to the company is expected to grow by more than double to 1,359MW by 2035 from around 600MW.

Station Details

The power station is a single-unit of 225 MW operated by the Montenegro utility Elektroprivreda Crne Gore. It has been in operation since 1982 and is fueled by lignite coal. It is Montenegro's only coal-fired power station and supplies up to 30% of the country's electric power. Most fuel is supplied from two surface mines operated by Rudnik uglja ad Pljevlja. The older mine is Potrlica, where mining began in 1952. Sumani I is a newer mine with lesser-quality lignite coal.[1]

In November 2019, Elektroprivreda Crne Gore picked a consortium led by China’s Dongfang Electric International Corporation to refurbish the 225 MW plant to bring it in line with European Union pollution standards. The project, set to be completed by 2021, should also extend the lifespan of the plant by 20 years.[2]

Expansion

The Montenegro government through its power utility Elektroprivreda Crne Gore (EPCG) plan to construct a new EUR 300 million, 220 MW lignite plant at the site of the existing Pljevlja lignite power plant in Pljevlja. The plant would use lignite from the nearby Pljevlja mine. As of 2013 the process of finding a strategic investor was ongoing.[3]

In April 2015 EPCG said it had chosen Czech engineering group Skoda Praha, owned by power utility CEZ, as preferred bidder to build the new coal-fired unit. Skoda Praha bid US$379 million to construct a 254-megawatt (MW) unit, while China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) offered US$376 million. Italian bank UniCredit will act as an adviser in selecting a possible partner to co-fund the project.[4]

Italy's A2A, a minority shareholder of Montenegrin utility EPCG with management rights in it, has resisted the idea of constructing the new coal plant.[5] However, the Government of Montenegro signed an agreement to continue cooperation with A2A on the plant. Construction is expected to start at the end of the year.[6]

In October 2016 it was reported that the Czech Export Bank and export credit agency EGAP had decided not to finance the project. It remains unclear who will fund it. According to Bankwatch, the project is financially unviable due to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme and declining costs of alternative energies relative to coal.[7]

In February 2017 the Environmental Protection Agency issued approval for the plant. In May 2017 Green Home, a Montenegrin environmental non-governmental organisation, submitted a complaint to the Administrative Court of Montenegro requesting the cancellation of the approval, saying it failed to include several elements stipulated by the Law on Environmental Impact Assessment, such as a justification for the decision, responses to comments provided during the public consultation, and a list of measures to address environmental damage during the construction and operation of the plant.[8]

In December 2017 the Montenegrin government terminated the contract with Skoda Praha to build the plant, leaving the project with no main contractor and no financing. Although Chinese company PowerChina has shown interest in the project, the Montenegrin government has decided to de-prioritise it for now, in favour of upgrading the existing plant to comply with its environmental obligations under the Energy Community Treaty.[9] However, the project has still not been officially cancelled.[10]

In May 2018 Chinese state owned company PowerChina, through its daughter company Sechuan Electric, sent an offer to the Montenegrin government for the construction of the TPP Pljevlja’s second block. The size is to be determined.[11]

In May 2019, EPCG Chairman Djoko Krivokapic said the construction of Pljevlja unit 2 is not a priority for the company, as it was focusing on renewable energy, namely wind and solar. EPCG is also planning to invest 60 million euros in environmental upgrades of TPP Pljevlja unit 1 by 2023.[12]

On September 18, 2019, Montenegrin Premier Duško Marković announced that the Government is no longer pursuing Pljevlja II: ""we will build something in line with our economic policy, sustainable development and preservation of the environment,"" he said.[13]

Opposition

The Montenegrin NGOs Green Home and MANS have criticised plans by the Montenegrin government to choose a strategic partner for Pljevlja II without conducting a proper tender, stating that instead the government planned to sign an intergovernmental agreement and enact a ""special law"" on the project, creating a legal loophole to move forward on Pljevlja II without proving its benefits.[3]

Germany’s exit from the coal industry marks the second major upheaval for RWE in as many years following the breakup of the .company’s former subsidiary Innogy (IGY.DE) with peer E.ON (EONGn.DE).

It also accelerates RWE’s transformation into a pure renewables group, which - along with its low valuation - could turn it into a takeover target, Goldman Sachs said last week.

RWE said it would receive 2.6 billion euros ($2.9 billion) in compensation from the government over 15 years to soften the blow to its business.

However, this was less than the 3.5 billion euro hit it estimated it would take, even excluding the expected loss of profits, it added.

“RWE stretches to the limits of what is possible,” Chief Executive Rolf Martin Schmitz told journalists on a call. “And we will bear the majority of the burden the German government demands for the coal phase-out.”

After months of wrangling, the German government early on Thursday agreed a compensation plan with energy companies, affected regions and workers to pay for the accelerated shutdown of coal-fired power stations by 2038.

RWE said it expected special writedowns of half a billion euros on power plants and open-cast mines as a result of the agreement. About 350 million euros will be set aside for personnel measures.

Shares in the group were 2% higher at 1508 GMT, the second-biggest gainers among German blue-chips, having earlier touched their highest since Sept. 25, 2014 as traders welcomed the clarity after months of wrangling.

“RWE’s agreement with the German government lifts an important overhang,” Bernstein analysts wrote.

“Some investors were cautious on whether RWE would be able to receive adequate compensation for early mine closures, given the past track record of negotiations with the government.”

Schmitz denied speculation that RWE may now seek to sell its coal assets, adding the firm, which is also Europe’s third-largest renewable group after Iberdrola (IBE.MC) and Enel (ENEI.MI), would stand by its employees.

“There are no such considerations and no talks on the matter,” Schmitz said.

The company has in the past denied claims that its coal-fired plants are loss-making, saying it would not run them unless they generated cash.

Dave Jones, European electricity analyst at Sandbag, a non-profit think-tank, said that it had been clear that coal would have to be phased out even before the Paris Agreement to combat climate change was struck in 2015.

“It’s a pertinent lesson for all other countries: deal with coal now, and save yourself a big bill in the future,” he said."	https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-germany-jobs/germanys-rwe-to-cut-one-in-three-jobs-in-2-9-billion-coal-exit-deal-idUSKBN1ZF1UX
Cancelled	"A Japanese-led public-private consortium is set to abandon a Turkish nuclear power project that had been touted as a model for Tokyo's export of infrastructure, according to a report by the Japanese media outlet Nikkei Asia Review.

The reason for Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' decision to scrap the project was reported to be the rising costs of the delayed construction, which have increased to 5 trillion yen ($44 billion). The original cost of the project was estimated at $22 billion. The increase in cost was mainly due to higher safety requirements following the 2011 meltdown at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant and a weaker Turkish lira, Nikkei said.

The main builder Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' decision to cancel the project is still under negotiations among parties and it was seen as a blow to the Japanese nuclear industry, looking for avenues of growth in overseas markets because it is unlikely that a new nuclear power plant will be built in the post-Fukushima country. In April, another Japanese member of the consortium, Itochu, was reported to be pulling out of the Sinop nuclear power plant project, citing a surge in safety-related costs, casting uncertainty over the plant's future as well as the Japanese government's infrastructure export ambitions.

The Japanese and Turkish governments agreed in 2013 on the project to be built with a Japanese-French consortium in the Black Sea province of Sinop. The bulk of the project would be financed by Nippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI), Japan's export credit agency, and French credit insurer Coface.

Botswana Power Corporation Launches Request For Proposal To Develop 12 Solar Power Projects With Last Date For Bid Submission being March 29, 2019

Botswana’s electricity utility Botswana Power Corporation (BPC) has decided to cancel its 100 MW solar power tender, with a promise to reissue a revised version by the end of June 2019, reported Reuters referring to a statement issued by the utility.

The reason behind the step is that BPC wants the project to be 100% private owned. Previously BPC planned the project to be a joint venture between itself and private producers. In its new avatar, the project should be implemented through independent power producers.

BPC had received 166 bids from local and international power producers in the expression of interest round of the tender that was launched in May 2017. The EoI included storage capacity as well. The Reuters report does not specify if the utility plans to have a storage component in the revised tender as well.

In November 2018, BPC was soliciting proposals for 12 solar power projects with the last date of submission being March 29, 2019 (see Botswana Solar Tender For 12 Projects).

In May 2019, Tlou Energy Limited, a coal bed methane (CBM) power company in Botswana secured an environmental impact assessment approval for its 20 MW CBM power generation project which will also have a solar farm of up to 20 MW capacity (see 20 MW Solar Farm Approved For Botswana)."	http://taiyangnews.info/markets/100-mw-botswana-solar-tender-cancelled/

In a statement, the company said the project — which was originally structured to consist of two 50 MW facilities, as part of a joint venture with potential private investors — will be now redefined as an IPP project, with investors to become 100% owners of the two plants.

“The project was nullified to allow for a fresh procurement process to be conducted with the new Terms of Reference (ToR) in line with the desired project structure,” BPC explained.

The company said that a new tender will be floated by the end of June. It also specified that potential investors will be expected to establish partnerships with local companies for joint project ownership, construction and O&M. If built, the two facilities will be country’s first large-scale PV plants.

According to Reuters, BPC received 166 bids from local and international power producers. It was the second solar tender that the utility has canceled in recent years. The government of Botswana issued a similar expression of interest for a concentrated solar power installation in 2015, but the project was never implemented. BPC also launched a new tender for 12 IPP solar projects last November.

Solar and renewables are expected to help Botswana reduce its dependence on power imports from troubled South African utility Eskom. However, the country faces the threat of continuous electricity shortages due to technical problems in its 600 MW coal-fired power plant, known as “Morupule B.” This plant is able to cover around 30% of electricity demand, with the remaining percentage coming from imports.

Despite its urgent need for more generating capacity, the African country had only installed 3 MW of solar capacity by the end of last year, according to the latest statistics from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). According to a recent report from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Botswana is one of a number of African countries that could meet 30% of their projected 2030 energy demand with low-impact solar PV."	https://www.pv-magazine.com/2019/05/27/botswana-cancels-100-mw-pv-tender-plans-new-procurement-exercise-for-june/

Cancelled	"The Mexican Ministry of Communications and Transportation has cancelled a MXP 59 billion (US$ 4.4 billion) contract for a consortium led by China Railway Construction Corp. to build a 210 km high-speed rail link. The cancelation came just three days after the contract was originally awarded.

On November 3, China Railway Construction announced that a consortium comprising itself, Chinese rolling stock maker CSR Corporation, and four Mexican companies had won the contract to build the 210 km high-speed rail link between Mexico City and Queretaro.

The scheme was to comprise a 40-month construction period, followed by just under five-years of operation and maintenance. Of the overall contract, some 60% of the construction value and all of the operational maintenance work – a total of some MXP 39 billion (US$ 2.7 billion) – was attributable to China Railway Construction.

However, on 6 November the Mexican Ministry of Communications and Transportation cancelled the contract, reportedly over criticism of how the bidding process had been carried out.

Other companies to initially show interest in the project had included Siemens, Alstom and Bombardier. However, some had reportedly said they were not given enough time to prepare bids. As a result, when the contract was awarded, the China Railway Construction consortium was the only group left in the running.

The project was to have been the first high-speed rail line in Latin America, and it would also have been the first foreign high-speed rail project built by a Chinese company."	https://www.khl.com/news/mexico-cancels-china-railway-construction-contract/102417.article

Cancelled	Kolkata: A staggering 47.4 GW coal fired power projects at different stages were cancelled in India in 2019 reducing total under development coal capacity to 66 GW.The data was compiled in a report 'Boom & Bust 2020' jointly compiled by Global Energy Monitor, Greenpeace International, the Sierra Club, and Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air CREA ).Pre-construction capacity halved in just the past year in India from 60.2 GW in 2018 to 29.3 GW in 2019 with another 37 GW in under-construction stage, according to the report.The report is the fifth annual survey of the coal plant pipeline. Its findings include a 16% year-on-year drop in capacity under construction and in pre-construction development, and a 66% drop since 2015 globally. Construction starts were down 5% from 2018 and 66% from 2015, compared to 2019.“8.1 GW coal based thermal capacity was commissioned in India in 2019 with 8.8 GW of new coal fired capacity entering the under-construction phase. All 8.8 GW of the new construction received substantial financing from the Power Finance Corporation or the Rural Electrification Corporation , which both fall under control of the Ministry of Power and are set to merge this year,” the report mentioned.A submission made by the power ministry in the parliament on 17th March 2020 further validates the findings. In their submission the ministry mentioned that more than 23 GW capacity of coal fired power stations belonging to the private sector from under-construction category compared to earlier data.Most of these plants started development before 2011. As the private sector is exiting coal plant development in India the public sector is stepping in and footing the bill.Even as coal power development shrank in India, the amount of new coal power capacity added to the grid in 2019 outpaced the retirement of end of life power plants, further negatively impacting power load factor of coal plants and indicating worsening overcapacity.“The shrinking coal pipeline in India forced by huge overcapacity, subdued demand for electricity, falling utilization factor, falling prices of renewable energy, drying investments, and increasing public resistance due to pollution gives hope for a future with reduced fossil footprint for India.But, at the same time new capacity is being added to the grid, new projects are given clearances and infusion of public money into new projects by the government raises concerns, said Sunil Dahiya, analyst at Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.“Looking at the climate, environmental and economic crisis we face today much more needs to be done and a strict policy to not build or clear any new coal based plant with rapid retirement of older units is urgently required.”Despite the decline in development, the coal fleet grew by 34.1 gigawatts (GW) globally in 2019, the first increase in net capacity additions since 2015. Nearly 64% (43.8 GW) of the 68.3 GW of newly commissioned capacity was in China and 12% (8.1 GW) in India.“Global power generation from coal fell by a record amount in 2019, as renewable energy grew and power demand slowed down,” said Christine Shearer, lead author and Director of Global Energy Monitor’s Coal Program.“Regardless, the number of new plants added to the grid accelerated, meaning that the world’s coal plants were operated a lot less – more plants generating less power. For banks and investors that continue to underwrite new coal plants, this means weakened profitability and increased risk.”	https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/47400-mw-coal-fired-power-projects-were-cancelled-in-india-in-2019-report/articleshow/74831848.cms?from=mdr

Cancelled	"Japanese conglomerate SoftBank Group has denied reports that its $200bn plan to build the world’s biggest solar power scheme in Saudi Arabia has been shelved.

It was responding to a report published 30 September in The Wall Street Journal that quoted an unnamed Saudi energy official as saying: “Everyone is just hoping this whole idea would just die.”

According to the WSJ, the programme, which is still at the discussion stage, would be shelved in favour of broader strategy to boost renewables.

SoftBank responded by issuing a written statement saying “progress continues to be in line with expectations for a project of this scale and complexity”, and that it would make a further announcement of its plans in the coming months.

Saudi Arabia’s solar potential

The Japanese giant added that its project team had been working closely with the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) and government agencies to deliver on the New Solar Energy Plan 2030 “to transform the future of renewable energy production in the kingdom.”

Softbank’s statement came after a PIF spokesperson said it was continuing to work with the SoftBank Vision Fund on “multibillion dollar projects relating to the solar industry”.

Masayoshi Son, richest man in Japan and founder of SoftBank, signed a preliminary agreement to work on a network of solar farms in March. The agreement was reached with Saudi crown prince Mohammed Bin Salman in New York during the prince’s three-week visit to America.

The plan was to base the kingdom’s future energy supply on solar farms with a total generating capacity of up to 200GW, with completion scheduled for 2030.

Thanh Nien (Young People) newspaper on February 11 reported that the land clearance progress of the expressway’s eastern section had been delayed.

The Ministry of Transport has warned that the whole project would be delayed if land clearance continued to lag behind schedule.

According to the Transport Project Quality and Construction Management Department, only 166 out of 653.6km of roads in 13 localities which the expressway’s eastern section runs through have been transferred to investors and the project’s management board.

Agricultural land was expected to be fully transferred before the end of 2019. Localities must complete land clearance by the second quarter this year.

If local authorities do not accelerate progress, land clearance will not be completed by the middle of this year, according to the department.

The newspaper also reported that the deadline for submitting the expressway’s design looks set to be missed.

The ministry has so far approved technical designs for 64 out of 401km, while the deadline to approve them all is February 20.

The ministry blamed the delay on the time need to collect feedback from many localities.

The PM asked the Ministry of Transport to clarify the delay.

The North-South Expressway, which is set to cover 2,109km and extend from the northern mountainous province of Lang Son to the southernmost province of Ca Mau, is a key national transport project for the 2017-2020 period.

It is expected to improve national competitiveness and attract foreign investment, as well as create more momentum for socio-economic development.

The expressway’s eastern section has 11 sub-projects, with three financed by the State and the rest using funding from the public-private partnership (PPP) model.

They have a total investment of 118.71 trillion VND (5.1 billion USD).

The construction of the first sub-project (Cam Lo-La Son) started last September. It runs through the central provinces of Quang Tri and Thua Thien-Hue for nearly 100km and is worth some 7.6 trillion VND.

The section is expected to be completed by next year.

The Ministry of Transport last year cancelled open international bidding for eight projects of the expressway in favour of homegrown investors.

The pre-qualification round of investor selection for eight PPP North-South Expressway projects will finish this month, according to the transport ministry. Bidding documents will be issued in April.

The bidding to select investors will be completed by November."	https://www.vir.com.vn/transport-ministry-asked-to-explain-north-south-expressway-delay-74132.html

Cancelled	"Last Sunday, the Wall Street Journal published an article, citing unnamed Saudi government officials, claiming that the kingdom’s plans to install 200 GW of solar PV had been shelved, with no one actively working on the project.

However, in an official statement released on October 2, Saudi Arabia’s MEIM refuted the claims, stating, “Contrary to recent media reports, MEIM alongside the Public Investment Fund, SoftBank and other Kingdom’s stakeholders continue to work on a number of large-scale, multi-billion dollar projects relating to the solar industry. The long-term goal of these investments is to manufacture 200 GW of PV capacity by 2030.”

It added that it has already invited investors, technical advisors, and contractors to participate in the program, although it did not expand on the details.

Abdulrahman Abdulkareem, advisor to the Minister of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources, also reportedly spoke at the 11th Annual Arab Energy Forum, held recently in Marrakesh. There, he was said to have outlined the Kingdom’s plan to “become a global leader in solar energy and to develop $200 billion of investment opportunities in this promising sector.”

In March, a memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed between the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdul Aziz, and Japan-based SoftBank founder, Masayoshi Son, to establish the US$200 billion, 200 GW solar project in Saudi Arabia by 2030.

At a briefing in New York, the United States, at the time, SoftBank’s Son said the project would also encompass equipment manufacturing and battery storage, with the potential for up to 100,000 jobs to be created and $40 billion in power cost savings.

Popular content

SoftBank said it intended to invest the funds via its Vision Fund – the largest technology investment fund, ever, and which has backing from Saudi Arabia and the UAE; and companies including Apple, Sharp and Foxconn.

“200 GW of solar would roughly cover total Saudi electricity demand in 2017. There seems no practical reason why this should not happen, especially as air conditioning demand in the country increases, and with battery backup. However, the details are likely to require extensive negotiation,” Jenny Chase, head of solar analysis at Bloomberg NEF told pv magazine at the time.

Power sector transformation

In the statement, MEIM also outlined three components for its power sector transformation plan. These include:

Restructuring the power market to enhance its competitiveness for consumers and its attractiveness for private sector investments;

Transitioning the Kingdom’s fuel and technology mix to include a significant capacity of renewables, primarily solar, but also wind. There will also be substantive investment in new high efficient gas-powered generation capacity; and

Investing, industrializing and localizing the full value chain of the power industry for domestic and export-oriented manufacturing of conventional power components and services, as well as new technologies.

“Key decisions regarding the transformation of the power sector have been taken, details of which will be announced in due course,” concluded the statement."	https://www.pv-magazine.com/2018/10/05/saudi-government-refutes-claims-that-200-gw-solar-project-has-been-scrapped/

Cancelled	"MALE (Reuters) - Maldives has cancelled its biggest foreign investment project, a $511 million deal with Indian firm GMR Group to develop its international airport, raising questions over the future of foreign investment in the islands renowned for luxury resorts.

The cancellation of the deal signed in 2010 follows President Mohamed Waheed’s failure to renegotiate terms, sources close to president’s office have told Reuters.

GMR, a subsidiary of Bangalore-based GMR Infrastructure Ltd (GMRI.NS), has been given seven days to leave the Indian Ocean island chain.

“It is cancelled by the cabinet on the instructions of the president. It was not a valid agreement,” Imad Masood, the president’s spokesman told Reuters late on Tuesday.

The cancellation raises concerns over investor protection in the Maldives, which is seeking foreign financing of tourism projects, and follows a year of political turmoil, with the ousting of a president and months of unrest.

In a statement GMR said the cabinet’s decision was “unilateral and completely irrational,” as legal arbitration over the deal was currently in the Singapore High Court.

“We are therefore taking all measures to ensure the safety of our employees and safeguard our assets. We are confident that the stand of the company will be vindicated in every way.”

The Maldives action exacerbated already strained relations with neighbouring India, which warned it would “take all necessary measures to ensure the safety and security of its interests and its nationals in the Maldives”.

“The government of India would...expect that Maldives would fulfill all legal processes and requirements in accordance with the relevant contracts and agreement it has concluded with GMR in this regard,” it said.

India said the move sends a “very negative signal to foreign investors and the international community”.

GMR won the contract in 2010 to upgrade and operate the Maldives airport and build a new terminal after a global tender overseen by the World Bank.

The deal with the GMR was signed under former president Mohamed Nasheed’s administration, following a competitive bidding process conducted by the World Bank’s International Finance Corporation (IFC).

The project was implemented through a joint venture company comprising GMR Infrastructure Limited and Malaysia Airports Holding Berhad (MAHB.KL).

However, Nasheed’s rivals filed legal action saying the contract was invalid as it contained a $25 airport development charge per outgoing passenger which was not authorised by the parliament.

Nasheed said in a statement that cancelling the GMR contract would deter potential investors for decades and accused the president of leading the Maldives down a path to economic ruin.

Maldives Attorney General Azima Shukoor said that although the agreement had stated that GMR should be given a 30-day notice of termination, the government believed that it need not be followed since the contract was void.

“The government has given a seven day notice to GMR to leave the airport,” said Shukoor, adding the government reached the decision after considering “technical, financial and economic” issues surrounding the agreement.

She gave no more reasons why the contract was invalid

Shukoor said the government had already informed both GMR and the Maldives Airports Company Limited of its decision.

It is not clear whether the Singapore arbitration case will continue after the Maldives nullified the contract."	https://www.reuters.com/article/maldives-india-gmr/maldives-cancels-gmrs-511-million-airport-project-idINDEE8AR01Z20121128

CHENNAI: The National Highways Authority of India ( NHAI ) has issued termination orders for four road projects in Tamil Nadu citing delay in land acquisition by the state government. The total cost of the projects is 4,929 crore.

Chairman of NHAI, Nagendra Nath Sinha has issued termination orders for four-laning of Villupuram-Puducherry section ( 998.7 crore), Puducherry-Poondiyankuppam section ( 1,294.5 crore) and Poondiankuppam-Sattanathapuram section of NH 45 A ( 2,153.4crore), according to reliable sources in NHAI.

Four-laning of the 180km stretch of Villupuram-Nagapattinam NH 45 A was taken up in four phases under the Centre's Bharatmala Pariyojana. The road project was taken up to reduce travelling time to major towns like Puducherry, Cuddalore, Chidambaram, Sirkazhi and Karaikkal and promote industrial growth and economic activities along the stretch.

""We received the termination orders from the headquarters two weeks ago,"" said an official in the Chennai regional office of NHAI. The orders say that the termination of the projects is effective from May 2019. The authority has taken the decision to avoid paying huge amount as compensation to the contractors for not handing over the land on time.

NHAI awarded the projects to the contractors in March 2018 under Hybrid Annuity Mode. As per the provision, the required land to execute the road project should have been handed over to the contractors within six months from entering into the agreement. ""But even after a year, we are not in a position to hand over the land,"" said the official.

Similarly, NHAI chairman has also issued termination order for two-laning of Meensurutti-Chidambaram section of NH 227, which was estimated to cost 482 crore.

However, the official said the state government had assured them to acquire the required land within two months time. ""We will float a fresh tender for the project only after receiving the required land. We have also disbursed the compensation to the owners of the land parcels that have already been acquired for the project,"" said the official.

Cancelled	"Projects to build 2,500 km of highways –— a large part of which were awarded in the third year of the UPA-II regime — have been cancelled. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) awarded most these projects in 2011-12. In the subsequent years — 2012-13 and 2013-14 — because of the economic slowdown, firms did not respond to many bids that were floated by the NHAI.

The projects that have been cancelled include Jabalpur-Lakhanadon (originally bagged by Ganone Dunkerley), Vadodara-Surat including Narmada bridge (HCC), Lucknow-Sultanpur (Essar-Atlanta), Hospet-Bellary (PNC-Betul), Karnataka-Kerala border–Kannur (Transtroy), Angul-Sambalpur (Abhijeet), Jabalpur-Katni-Rewa (Soma Tollways) and Raipur-Bilaspur (IVRCL Assets). “Some 23 projects — most of which were awarded in 2011-12 — have been cancelled, foreclosed or terminated because of developers not paying performance guarantees or due to delays in land acquisition or environmental clearances. Two of the cancelled projects have been re-awarded,” said an NHAI official.

Fresh bids for such projects can be invited only after an inter-Ministerial body — the public-private partnership appraisal committee — revises the costs upwards taking into account the inflation since the time the project was awarded. The list of cancelled projects is likely to get longer, say NHAI and industry sources.

This is because many road developers who have not yet started working on projects awarded two-three years ago are yet to take a clear stance on whether they will continue or surrender the projects after evaluating the premium re-scheduling proposal.

In October 2018, GMR had emerged as the highest bidder for the development, operations and management of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar International Airport, Nagpur, in public private partnership (PPP) mode. GVK had also submitted a bid.

GMR was awarded the mandate by Mihan, the authority entrusted with the task of developing the airport, in March 2019.

Mihan is a joint venture between Maharashtra Airport Development Company (a Government of Maharashtra undertaking) and the Airports Authority of India. It had started the RFP (request for proposal) process to privatise the Nagpur Airport in March 2018. The proposed 30-year contract included the construction of a new terminal amongst other works. GMR had offered a higher revenue share and won the bid. However, some glitches with regard to the revenue share seem to have impacted the contract, as hinted at by a Union Minister earlier this year.

The contract was cancelled as the Maharashtra government was not happy with the revenue share quoted by GMR in the tender. The matter is likely to be contested and possibly renegotiated, said a statement.

In FY18, Nagpur Airport had handled 2.18 million passengers and 7,800 mt cargo. Over the past five years, the passenger traffic at the airport has grown at a CAGR of 11 per cent."	https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/mihan-cancels-gmr-mandate-contract-for-nagpur-airport-development/article31647096.ece

Cancelled	"KUWAIT (Reuters) - The Kuwaiti cabinet cancelled plans to construct the Al-Dabdaba solar plant, which would have provided 15 percent of the oil sector’s needs of electrical energy, due to the coronavirus pandemic.

“The cabinet decided to cancel the decisions on the project due to the spread of coronavirus and its impacts on the global oil and financial markets,” it said after meeting on Monday.

The project, which was to be carried out by Kuwait National Petroleum Company (KNPC), was supposed to start operating in February 2021. But the proposal was extremely delayed due to bureaucratic procedures.

The lowest bid for the project was 439 million Kuwaiti dinars ($1.4 billion), Kuwait’s Alrai newspaper said on July 5.

Kuwait has plans to generate 15 percent of its energy via renewable sources by 2030.

The decision would contribute to the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC) “focusing on its priorities for the coming stage and maintaining its position in the global oil markets”, the cabinet statement said.

The project was aimed at establishing a solar power plant within the Al-Shikaya Complex for Renewable Energy, which is located 100 kms (62 miles) west of Kuwait City, on about 32 square kilometres (12.4 square miles)."	https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kuwait-solar-plant/kuwait-cancels-al-dabdaba-solar-plant-project-due-to-coronavirus-idUSKCN24E2XQ
Cancelled	"SINGAPORE (BLOOMBERG) - Malaysia has finally scrapped three China-backed pipeline projects after halting work on them following the shock elections in May that saw an opposition alliance assuming power for the first time in the country.

A finance ministry spokeswoman confirmed that the country has cancelled three China-backed pipeline projects.

The Financial Times earlier cited Malaysian Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng saying he had sent a letter to ""relevant parties"" in Beijing to terminate the planned projects.

The plans comprise two oil and gas pipelines that cost more than US$1 billion (S$1.4 billion) each as well as a US$795 million pipeline that would link the state of Melaka to a refinery and petrochemical plant in the state of Johor, the paper reported.

Mr Lim did not disclose the cancellation fees Malaysia would incur for cancelling the pipeline projects but said that lawyers were handling the matter, the report said.

Since taking office, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has been reviewing infrastructure projects undertaken by the former administration.

The cost-cutting efforts are aimed at tackling the country's liabilities which have surged above RM1 trillion (S$333 billion) due to state guarantees on borrowing by state investment firm 1MDB, which is at the centre of a multibillion-dollar scandal.

Mr Lim also told the Financial Times that another China-backed project - the East Coast Rail Link - was under review. That project is being built by China Communications Construction Co.

In a visit to Beijing last month, Tun Dr Mahathir warned against new 'colonialism' and called for free trade that was also ""fair"".

Last week, Malaysia and Singapore agreed to postpone a multibillion-dollar high-speed rail project between the two countries until the end of May 2020."	https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/malaysia-finally-scraps-s41b-of-china-backed-pipelines-after-halting-work-for-months

Mahathir made the comments while addressing the media in Beijing during his five-day trip to China. He said the projects, would be canceled until such time as Malaysia can afford it.

The Prime Minister’s office confirmed the comments Mahathir made to reporters in Beijing.

Prior to his China visit, Mahathir had vowed repeatedly to discuss what he called “unfair” Chinese infrastructure deals authorized by his predecessor Najib Razak, whose near-decade long rule ended in electoral defeat in May amid a massive financial scandal.

Mahathir said he relayed the matter to China and they understood the problems faced by Malaysia, the New Straits Times (NST) reported.

“I believe China itself does not want to see Malaysia become a bankrupt country,” the NST quoted him as saying during a press conference marking the end of his China trip.

The ECRL project was the centerpiece of China’s infrastructure push in Malaysia but work has been suspended pending discussions over pricing and graft accusations.

Project contractor, China Communications Construction Co Ltd told Reuters that more than 1,800 of the 2,250 people hired for the ECRL project had been laid off since the suspension.

Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang told a daily news briefing in Beijing that Mahathir had said during his visit that China’s development was an opportunity for Malaysia.

Both countries’ peoples benefit from their trade and business relations, Lu said on Tuesday.

“But in the cooperation between any two countries, it can’t be avoided that there may be various kinds of problems, and different views at different times.”

Lu said such differences should be “appropriately resolved by friendly consultations”, and that it was an important consensus reached by both countries.

Mahathir said in a joint press conference with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Monday that he believed China would sympathize with Malaysia’s “internal fiscal problems”.

Mahathir also told the press on Tuesday that he did not bring up Low Taek Jho, the Malaysian financier wanted for his role in the multi-billion-dollar scandal at state fund 1MDB, in his dialogue with the Chinese leaders, local reports said.

The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Malaysia believed Low was being harbored in China and that a request to extradite him would be high on Mahathir’s agenda.

Mahathir’s predecessor Najib Razak is set to stand trial in February next year on charges linked to a multi-billion-dollar scandal at state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).

Cancelled	Pakistan has withdrawn its request to include the $14-billion Diamer-Bhasha Dam in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) framework after Beijing placed strict conditions including ownership of the project, said Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) Chairman Muzammil Hussain on Tuesday.“Chinese conditions for financing the Diamer-Bhasha Dam were not doable and against our interests,” said Hussain while briefing the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) on the status of the mega water and power project.He said the Chinese conditions were about taking ownership of the project, operation and maintenance cost and securitisation of the Diamer-Bhasha project by pledging another operational dam.These conditions were unacceptable, therefore, Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi approved a summary to finance the dam from the country’s own resources, he said.The issue of excluding the Diamer-Bhasha Dam from the CPEC framework also featured in the Cabinet Committee on CPEC which met last week.The Wapda chairman and the water resources secretary informed the premier that the only way out was to fund the much-delayed project from domestic resources.The sixth meeting of the Joint Cooperation Committee (JCC) - the highest decision-making body of CPEC - had agreed to establish a mechanism to develop hydroelectric power projects along the northern side of the Indus River including the Diamer-Bhasha project, according to minutes of the deliberations.Pakistan decided to take the dam off the table just days before the seventh JCC meeting, which is scheduled for November 21 in Islamabad. The JCC will review progress on the implementation of already approved projects and decide the fate of new schemes.Currently, about 15 prioritised energy projects valuing at $22.4 billion and having 11,110-megawatt generation capacity are part of the CPEC framework. Among these, only two are hydroelectric power projects with cumulative capacity of 1,590MW. Most of the CPEC energy projects are based on coal.Pakistan has been struggling to raise money from international institutions amid Indian opposition to the project. There were hopes that Pakistan may finally complete the project after including it in the CPEC framework whose worth has already swelled to $60 billion.Ground-breaking of the Diamer-Bhasha Dam has been performed five times in the past 15 years.Neither the World Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB) nor China would finance the dam, therefore, the government decided to construct the reservoir from its own resources, said Water Resources Secretary Shumail Khawaja.The Wapda chairman blamed the ADB for the delay, saying the bank first destroyed the project and later declined to provide loan. The ADB was of the view that the project was located in a disputed territory, he said.The project will have the capacity to generate 4,500MW of electricity in addition to the storage capacity for six million acre feet of water, which the country desperately needs due to shrinking storages.The Wapda chairman said the project cost would hover around $14 billion and the prime minister had agreed to split the scheme into dam storage and power generation.According to the new financing plan, he said, the federal government would provide Rs30 billion per annum over the next nine years from the Public Sector Development Programme, taking total federal contribution to Rs270 billion.Hussain said Wapda would generate 20% of equity from its own resources whereas financing for constructing power plants would be arranged from commercial sources.Construction work on the dam site would begin next year and the government would complete it in nine years, he said. Work on the power generation site will begin two and a half years after the start of work on the dam.The Wapda chairman said 969MW Neelum-Jhelum and 1,410MW Tarbela extension projects would be commissioned in February next year.Published in The Express Tribune, November 15, 2017.Like Business on Facebook , follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.	https://tribune.com.pk/story/1558475/pakistan-stops-bid-include-diamer-bhasha-dam-cpec

Background on Plant

Provinces like Tekirdağ, Kırklareli and Edirne in Trakya region of Turkey, have large agriculture and forest lands that planned coal power plants such as Eren-1, Vize or Çerkezköy, brought forward spatial plan revisions. Lignite reserves were previously explored in Çerkezköy basin,[1] the oldest geological reconnaissance for Trakya (Trace) region dates back to 1954,[2] and the use of lignite coal has been a priority under Turkey's energy strategy since 2009.[3]

In October 2016, Cerkezkoy plant was announced by Elektrik Üretim (EÜAŞ), the state-controlled power agency, to be built between Cerkezkoy town of Tekirdag and Silivri town of Istanbul[4] by the revision of upper-scale spatial plan.[5] By the revision, plant area that covers both Istanbul and Tekirdag cities was declared ""energy generation area""; the revised plan was also announcing Vize power station. In February 2017, an emergency expropriation was issued to expedite the process.[6] Local community, Çerkezköy municipality, chambers and environmental groups[7] opened legal cases against expropriation and the spatial plan change. In September 2017, state council decided against the emergency expropriation.[8]

On 17th October 2017, the Ministry of Environment changed the spatial plan for Çerkezköy second time, as the plant coordinates had been changed. According to the new spatial plan, the plant was moved a little away from Istanbul to an area between Pınarca and Kapaklı districts of Çerkezköy town and the new plant area also was declared ""energy generation area"".[9] In November 2017, the EIA report, the official document that listed technical details for the first time, announced; the plant was planned to be 3 units x 330 MW capacity.[10] The company continue to environmental permission procedures despite the oppositions.[8] On 1st February 2018, the public permitting meeting as a part of EIA process was planned to be held. However, it is reported that some of the local community were not allowed to enter the meeting room, as a result, the protest grew and the meeting was cancelled.[11]

On public permitting meeting day, the protest grew as some locals were not allowed to enter the meeting room, Feb 2018, ©Çerkezköy Haber.

In December 2018, AKP Tekirdağ parliamentarians announced on their social media that the plant had been cancelled due to ""technical"" reasons.[12] On 4 February 2019, the Ministry of Environment and Urbanisation cancelled ""EIA positive decision"" of the plant.[13] However as the May 2019, the revised spatial plans that marks the region as ""energy generation area"" had not been changed.[14] According to CAN Europe, the plant is shelved.[15]

Environmental Impact

The plant is proposed to be built on agricultural and forest lands, environmental groups claim that it would cause 500 hectares of deforestation.[13] Çerkezköy plant had been protested several times by the local communities due to environmental and health concerns.[16] Greenpeace's report in 2018 estimates that Çerkezköy coal power plant would cause 141 premature deaths annually due to the exposure to PM 2.5 and NO 2 air pollutants.[17]

Costs

The Chamber of Electrical Engineers states that, due to a 15-year government purchase guarantee, the total cost of electricity from the plant could amount to 5.4 million US dollars (20.3 million lira) and that that would be a bad deal compared to renewable energy.[18]

HÀ NỘI — The transport ministry announced on Monday they would cancel open international bidding for eight projects of the North-South expressway, in favour of homegrown investors.

The decision was made on the consensus reached after consulting relevant agencies, transport ministry said in an announcement sent to the media, adding that it would adjust pre-qualification bidding invitations to better suit open domestic bids for eight public-private-partnership (PPP) projects for the eastern section of the trans-Việt Nam highway.

The ministry's project management boards had received 60 applications as of the end of July, two months after the international bidding invitation.

Four of the projects did not have investors that passed the prequalification requirements; two projects had only one; one project had two; and one project had three, according to the report made by the procuring entity and State agencies.

“The number of investors passing this stage was not high, leading to a lack of competition,” the ministry said.

As a result, the projects for the eastern section of the North-South Expressway are being re-examined to take into account global and regional disputes and national security concerns, as well as the empowerment of domestic enterprises.

Domestic investors, according to the ministry, are fully capable of implementing construction sub-projects for the expressway project.

However, experts have pointed out that Vietnamese investors face major challenges because of financial limitations, which would require them to seek alliances (in the form of joint-ventures) to pass the prequalification stage.

Nguyễn Danh Huy, general director of the ministry's Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Investment Project Management Department, told Vietnam News Agency that the criteria for investors would remain unchanged and would be in line on the Law on Bidding.

Domestic investors have been asked to meet the minimum standards specified by the law and Government Decree No. 20, and to have equity capital that reaches 20 per cent of the total costs. Or, the investor could have total capital that is equal to at least 50 per cent of the total investment for the project under construction.

“Investors who satisfy all the requirements can attend the prequalification for the eastern section project for the North-South Expressway,” Huy said.

Regarding the criteria for having ""at least 50 per cent of the total investment for a project under construction”, Huy said investors could form a joint-venture with another investor.

“The ministry will meet with related ministries and agencies soon to discuss the issue. The plan is to hold another prequalification in October and results are expected to be released by 2020,” he added.

Đặng Đại, deputy head of the Việt Nam Association of Financial Investors, said that domestic investors have the appropriate capacity and the construction techniques to carry out the project.

“Domestic investors only need to pay attention to the capital for eight eastern sections in which the State commits to ensure 30 per cent of the total investment capital. Therefore, investors are responsible for 20 per cent, so the rest can be mobilised from loans. Domestic investors definitely can fund the 20 per cent. For technical issues, many of them have carried out expressway, bridge and tunnel projects, which have shown their capability,” Đại said.

Transport expert Nguyễn Xuân Thuỷ said that domestic investors should be given priority for the key national projects like the North-South Expressway to ensure quality and reduce costs.

“Only a few international investors joined the bidding because they may have not met the criteria or they were concerned about issues related to procedures, capital, interest, and other matters. Also, the project might not be attractive enough for them,” said Thuỷ.

Since domestic investors would likely face financial challenges, he recommended that they cooperate with others.

“Large Vietnamese corporations such as Vingroup, Sun Group and T&T can work with road construction companies to have sufficient financial resources and at the same time meet standards related to experience,"" Thuỷ said.

The eastern section of the expressway will be 654km long and have total investment of VNĐ118.7 trillion (US$5.1 billion), including VNĐ55 trillion ($2.36 billion) allocated from the State budget.

It will run through 13 provinces and cities from the northern province of Nam Định to the southern province of Vĩnh Long.

The highway is divided into 11 sub-projects, including eight under PPP investment. — VNS"	https://vietnamnews.vn/society/535926/transport-ministry-cancelled-international-bidding-for-north-south-expressway-seeks-bids-from-domestic-investors.html

The Al-Dabdaba solar project is also part of the country’s plans to produce 15% of its electricity needs from renewable sources by 2030.

In September 2018, KNPC had launched a tender for the construction of the solar power project.

According to Kuwait’s Alrai newspaper, the lowest bid received for the project was $1.4bn.

The Dabdaba complex was proposed to be built within the Al-Shagaya Renewable Energy Park, close to the Saudi Arabian border.

The solar project was estimated to have generated electricity equivalent to at least 3,150 GWh in the twenty-fifth year of its operations.

The Belt and Road Initiative may experience short-term delays from the COVID-19 pandemic, but its long-term momentum will be sustained and even strengthened with multibillion-dollar projects from Latin America to South Asia underway.

The impact of COVID-19 in countries around the world is very visible at the moment. Similarly, projects along the BRI have been slowed by lockdowns and travel restrictions. However, these short-term setbacks are unlikely to derail projects with horizons spanning years.

""We expect infrastructure projects to be delayed due to weaker financial sentiment and supply chain disruptions, but strong demand and a pipeline of projects continue to point to a post-crisis rebound,"" Jangping Thia, manager of the economics unit at the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, said.

The big cause of any setbacks in BRI projects are travel restrictions and border control.

For example, work on Sri Lanka's Port City Colombo project has been slowed by travel restrictions as Chinese workers have not been able to return to work.

Workers on the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway project are also unable to return to Indonesia after the Lunar New Year holiday.

As much as 14 percent of workers on the project are Chinese nationals, according to PT Kereta Cepat Indonesia China, the railway consortium that will operate high-speed rail systems in Indonesia.

""The progress of a handful of infrastructure projects undertaken by Chinese contractors outside of China will face continued delays due to the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Some of these projects are part of China-led BRI,"" Jason Yek, Asia country risk analyst for Fitch Solutions, said.

Out of all the projects currently under construction, the value of all projects involving Chinese contractors is estimated to be in excess of $300 billion, said Yek.

""Most projects involving Chinese contractors are located in Asian markets such as Indonesia, Pakistan and Laos, and projects that utilize a higher proportion of Chinese labor face elevated risks of delays.""

As more countries in Asia and South America adopt stricter border control measures, exchanges and trade could be on the uphill.

Some of these BRI projects could experience some delays in the first half of 2020.

Nicholas Ho, deputy managing director of Ho& Partners Architects Engineers & Development Consultants Ltd, has seen how stricter border controls have affected construction in Hong Kong.

""The limit on lorries and vans going across the border have affected the supply chain side of the industry, such as the modules used in modulated integrated construction,"" Ho said.

Since the outbreak and lockdowns started in late January, supply chains have been disrupted as has industrial production in China, which is now bidding to resume normal operations.

High-frequency indicators suggest that production in the Chinese mainland as a whole fell sharply in February, Abdul Abiad, director of the macroeconomics research division for the Asian Development Bank, said.

""There have been substantial production disruptions as a result of forced business closures and the inability of workers to get to work, as well as disruptions to trade and business as a result of border closures, travel bans, and other restrictions on the movement of goods, people, and capital.""

But Abdul said production levels in the mainland are now beginning to normalize.

""Readiness to deal with epidemics is correlated to quality of infrastructure. Developing economies need to invest in public health infrastructure as a key part of epidemic preparedness,"" said Thia of AIIB.

But he says public health infrastructure needs parallel investment in information and communications technology as it improves efficiency in healthcare delivery and epidemic control.

""We continue to hold a positive long-term view for the BRI to play a central role in the development of infrastructure and industries for a large number of BRI countries, although short-term pushbacks are expected as well,"" said Yek of Fitch Solutions.

And new kinds of projects might emerge.

""Once China has recovered from the situation, it might be able to offer a different sort of diplomacy by offering its medical expertise and supplies to countries that need it,"" said Ho of HPA, whose firm has projects in BRI countries.

For example, the pandemic might create a demand for more healthcare facilities along the BRI.

In the end, said Ho, projects might be delayed but will ultimately continue and he is confident that business appetite will rebound: ""In the long run, a few months' delay is not going to stop an initiative like the Belt and Road."""	https://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202003/26/WS5e7c0e74a310128217282227.html
Cancelled	"Kuwait National Petroleum Company's Shuaiba oil refinery, due to benefit from the Al-Dabdaba complex. Image: KNPC.

Kuwait has cancelled a 1.5GW solar project meant to power the country’s state-owned petrol company citing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Having originally tendered for the project in September 2018, the 1.5GW complex was expected to start construction last year prior to commencing operations in early 2021.

But delays beset the project and Kuwait’s cabinet has now confirmed it will not proceed. In a statement issued via Kuwait’s news agency, the cabinet confirmed it had elected to cancel all decision on the project due to the onset of novel coronavirus pandemic and its impact on global oil and financial markets.

The cabinet reached the decision during a virtual cabinet meeting held yesterday following recommendations from Kuwait’s economic affairs committee, the statement read.

The ongoing pandemic has sent shockwaves through global oil and financial markets, with numerous reports of delays to finance deals and a collapsing oil price triggered by tumbling energy demand. The International Energy Agency warned in April of an “historic shock” for global energy markets, with oil demand the hardest hit, falling by 9% in 2020.

The 1.5GW Al-Dabdaba solar project was initially intended to be constructed in five blocks of up to 300MW, based in the Al-Shagaya Renewable Energy Park near Kuwait’s border with Saudi Arabia. It was to supply renewable power to the Kuwait National Petroleum Company under a 25-year agreement."	https://www.pv-tech.org/news/kuwait-cancels-1.5gw-al-dabdaba-solar-complex-amidst-oil-crash
Delayed	"(Reuters) - A U.S. government agency has delayed issuing a permit for the Gemini solar power project in Nevada, one of the country’s largest proposed solar farms, over concerns about its impact on a historic region traversed by settlers of the American West.

The U.S. Bureau of Land Management missed its target to decide on the so-called Section 106 permit governing the project’s historic impact by the end of March, after overshooting a previous deadline in December.

BLM spokeswoman Kirsten Cannon told Reuters this week the bureau can no longer give a timeframe for a decision but said it was working “expeditiously” to finish the work.

A draft agreement between BLM and the Nevada State Historic Preservation Office, viewed by Reuters, said the $1 billion project covering 7,100 acres (28.7 square kilometers) of federal land outside Las Vegas would have a visual impact on a historic railroad camp on the Moapa River Indian Reservation.

It would also have an impact on old travel and trade routes, including the Old Spanish National Historic Trail used by settlers in the 1830s to 1860s.

Nevada utility NV Energy, a subsidiary of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, said it still expects to complete the project on time in 2023, providing 690 megawatts for around 400,000 homes.

“The Gemini Solar project is a large, important part of our future renewable portfolio and we look forward to their successful on-time completion,” said NV Energy spokeswoman Kristen Saibini.

The project’s California-based developer, Arevia Power, said it too was hopeful regulators would act quickly. It suggested the coronavirus pandemic may have pushed the permit decision down the government’s list of priorities.

“In the current circumstances impacting federal government priorities, it would be prudent not to speculate,” Arevia Managing Partner Ricardo Graf said in an emailed statement.

Graf added that he did not expect the delay to impact the project’s ability to qualify for a critical federal tax credit for solar energy projects that is stepping down annually.

“Gemini’s status is not predicated on full scale construction commencing this year,” Graf said.

Many infrastructure projects are facing construction and supply chain delays due to the coronavirus pandemic. About a third of the nation’s planned utility-scale solar capacity could be slowed by the crisis, according to a report by energy research firm Wood Mackenzie published this week."	https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-solar-project/huge-us-solar-project-permit-delayed-over-impact-on-historic-trail-idUSKBN21K2V0
Delayed	"Houston — Kinder Morgan's 2 Bcf/d Permian Highway Pipeline, which had been scheduled to enter service in the fourth quarter of 2020, will not be brought online until early in 2021, CEO Steven Kean said late Wednesday during the company's third-quarter 2019 earnings call.

""We have about 85% of the [Permian Highway] right-of-way acquired and currently expect that we're going to timely acquire the easements we need,"" Kean said.

Kean blamed the later start-up date on delays in securing needed permits for the project, designed to carry natural gas from the Permian Basin in West Texas to the Texas Gulf Coast region.

""We are still obtaining some of the regulatory authorizations that we need, and that has progressed a little more slowly than what we put in our plan,"" he said. ""That means in order to do efficient construction, we will kick off the construction a little bit later.""

The company does not anticipate further delays in the permitting process, Kean said.

In addition, the company will likely put plans to build another 2 Bcf/d pipeline to carry gas from the prolific Permian Basin on hold. Kean said work on Kinder Morgan's proposed Permian Pass pipeline will probably be delayed beyond 2022. He described the proposed project as a ""work in progress"" and said it has not been added to the company's backlog of projects.

""Since we reported on this on the second-quarter call, the commercial activity has slowed, but it continues,"" Kean said. ""It slowed as a result of some producer retrenchment in their Permian activities.""

He added that the pipeline would still be needed in the long-term, ""but it may not be needed quite as soon as we were expecting three months ago. With a total of three new 2 Bcf/d projects coming online over the 2019 to 2021 period -- both of ours as well as the third-party pipeline -- the Permian Pass pipeline may not be needed in 2022.""

TRANSPORTATION VOLUMES

In its Q3 operational activity, the company said natural gas transportation volumes rose 13% compared with Q3 2018, with the largest increase on El Paso Natural Gas (EPNG), Tennessee Gas Pipeline (TGP) and Kinder Morgan Louisiana Pipeline, followed by Colorado Interstate Gas Co. (CIG), Gulf Coast Express Pipeline (GCX) and Wyoming Interstate Co. (WIC).

The increase marked the seventh quarter in a row in which volumes exceeded those of the comparable prior-year period by 10% or more, Kinder Morgan said in its Q3 earnings statement. Transportation volumes on EPNG benefited from Permian-related activity and increased throughput for California storage refill, while TGP's hike was due to projects being placed in service, the company said.

KMLP's gas transportation volumes increase occurred after the Sabine Pass Expansion entered service, while volumes on CIG rose due to increased production in the Denver-Julesburg Basin and increased coal-to-gas fuel switching for power generation, it said.

The company reported that its GCX pipeline entered service on September 25, ahead of schedule, while WIC saw higher flows from the DJ and Powder River basins.

Kinder Morgan said its Q3 gas gathering volumes rose 12% year on year due primarily to higher volumes on the KinderHawk, South Texas and Eagle Ford Midstream systems. NGL transport volumes climbed 10% year on year, due to higher Cochin volumes, the company reported.

ELBA ISLAND

Kean said a delay in the start of operations at the company's Elba Island LNG project was ""a drag"" on its third-quarter 2019 performance and contributed to a cut in its 2019 earnings forecast.

Hold-ups in the start of operations at the liquefaction plant in Georgia and other factors such as lower commodity prices will dent the company's 2019 adjusted EBITDA by about 3% compared with a budgeted $7.8 billion, the Houston-based midstream giant said.

Kean sought to reassure investors that the delays are behind the project and production at Elba Island will increase as new units are added in the coming months. The first of 10 units at the facility entered service in September.

KINDER MORGAN CANADA

The sale of Kinder Morgan's publicly traded Canadian company, Kinder Morgan Canada, to Pembina Pipeline is progressing, and the company continues to anticipate it will close by late 2019 or early 2020.

Dax Sanders, the executive responsible for the Canadian business, said shareholders will vote on the proposal at a meeting December 10 and some approvals by Canadian regulators remain outstanding. Kinder Morgan holds the majority of Kinder Morgan Canada shares.

Kinder Morgan reported third-quarter adjusted EBITDA of $1.83 billion, compared with $1.86 billion in the year-ago period. The S&P Global Market Intelligence consensus adjusted EBITDA estimate was $1.86 billion.

Delayed	"Up to 30 Lao laborers working on a nearly completed railway project that will connect landlocked Laos with China say that they have not been paid in three to four months, because their Chinese employers left the area and went home early this year amid the spread of the coronavirus.

Workers, especially heavy truck drivers, in Na Mo district of northwestern Laos’ Oudomxay province told RFA on Monday that their Chinese bosses have not given them a reason for the salary delays or informed them when they will be paid.

“There are about 20 to 30 workers who have not been paid,” said one Lao laborer who declined to give his name out of fear that he might lose his job. “The Chinese employers who were working on the project when the disease outbreak occurred went back home without paying the workers.”

“They only told them to continue working,” he added.

A Lao truck driver who is among the workers who have not received their salaries said he did not know when he would receive payment.

“Late — about three to four months,” said the driver, who declined to give his name for fear he would lose his job.

“Many workers are being paid late,” he said. “We don’t know when will get it, but we’re still working as truck drivers as usual.”

Workers are concerned about the delayed compensation because they do not have enough money now to buy food, pay their rent, or purchase essential items for their families, the truck driver said.

Though some workers want to quit their jobs, they are putting up with the situation because they have nowhere else to turn for employment, he said.

The truck driver said he did not know if Chinese employees working on the project in the area had received their salaries.

RFA was unable to reach the Vientiane office of Lao Railways — the national rail authority — or Na Mor district’s labor office for comment.

Other Lao nationals working inside the country on the railway project also have reported not being paid their salaries by their Chinese employers.

On April 1, a group of ethnic Hmong workers asked their Chinese supervisor for their salaries and took a company truck as collateral after an argument broke out.

Construction sector

Laos largely has been spared from the effects of the coronavirus, reporting only 19 cases since March 24, but no related fatalities.

A government order limiting the number of workers and requiring nonessential workers to remain at home to prevent the spread of the pathogen has led to the shutdown of some industries.

The construction sector, however, has been allowed to continue operating, although with fewer laborers on hand.

The Lao-China railway project — now 90 percent complete — is being touted as a boon for the impoverished nation of nearly 7 million people because it is expected to lower the cost of exports and consumer goods while boosting socioeconomic development.

The estimated U.S. $6 billion project, whose construction began in December 2016, is part of a longer rail line that will link China to mainland Southeast Asia under Chinese President Xi Jinping’s massive Belt and Road Initiative.

Delayed	"A contender for the largest solar plant in the U.S. is still waiting for a key permit after a federal agency missed its March issuing deadline.

The Gemini Solar Project, a 690-megawatt array Arevia Power is developing in Nevada, needs a Bureau of Land Management permit pertaining to its impact on historic sites, according to reporting from Reuters. The delay for that permit, called Section 106, has paused a review from the Army Corps of Engineers required under the U.S. Clean Water Act. In January, the Department of the Interior indicated it would give final approval to Gemini, despite some concerns from conservation groups about environmental impacts.

Both the developer and Nevada utility NV Energy, the project's offtaker, said the BLM holdup should not impact the project’s overall timeline. Backed by investor Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners, the project's PPA with NV Energy was approved by state regulators in December.

It's unclear if the coronavirus slowed down the Bureau of Land Management's permit process for Gemini. But the current pandemic is likely to extend deadlines for numerous other large-scale projects in the U.S., as its impacts creep from weeks to months.

Ricardo Graf, managing partner at California-based Arevia, said the virus has not impacted the developer’s timelines for Gemini or any other projects in the works. The company did not comment on whether it was considering the potential for any force majeure claims, an option that large-scale developers are increasingly eyeing as a possibility as the coronavirus throws timelines off-track.

Though the federal government has categorized solar maintenance and construction among “essential” businesses that can continue work during shutdowns, some work delays are nearly guaranteed due to supply chain snags and construction slowdowns. Depending on the unfolding impact of the virus, delays could hit between 2 and 5 gigawatts of large-scale solar projects, according to recently released analysis from Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables.

In the prevailing environment of uncertainty, utilities, permit offices and other stakeholders are unlikely to prioritize the advancement of projects above more pressing activities, like ensuring they can respond to electricity demand.

BLM declined to offer a specific permitting timeline for the Gemini project, but said it was “expeditiously working” to finalize the needed approvals.

Arevia also declined to offer up a specific timeline for moving past the permitting hurdle.

“In the current circumstances impacting federal government priorities, it would be prudent not to speculate,” said Graf, in an email. “BLM has been consistent to date in meeting its timelines and we are confident the process is working as best it can right now.”

Despite the delay, Gemini, like many large-scale projects, can take advantage of long project timelines to catch up. The project is not slated for operation until 2023. Graf said Gemini is not currently at risk of missing that date, or its plans to qualify for the investment tax credit.

When built, Gemini is expected to rank as the largest solar project in the U.S., with a significant storage add-on of 380 megawatts. The project is a key component of NV Energy’s renewables plans, part of adhering to a Nevada law requiring 50 percent renewables by 2030 that the state passed last year."	https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/would-be-largest-u.s-solar-project-hits-permit-hiccup
Delayed	"The construction of the Padma Bridge may be affected if the coronavirus situation does not improve within the next two months, Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader said yesterday.

“We would not face any problem regarding Padma Bridge’s construction if the impasse [centring coronavirus] is over within two months… There would be some problem if it lingers for three-four months,” he said.

Quader, also the general secretary of ruling Awami League, said this while speaking to reporters at his secretariat office after holding a review meeting on the development projects under his ministry.

Meanwhile, Railways Minister Nurul Islam Sujan said coronavirus would also impact railways projects.

“Bangladesh and China are maintaining a relationship of mutual cooperation and China is a major development partner of Bangladesh, so it [coronavirus] would impact both Bangladesh and China,” Sujan told reporters at Rail Bhaban.

Railways Ministry Senior Secretary Mofazzel Hossain said 878 Chinese nationals are working for the Padma Bridge Rail Link and they are staying at several subcamps.

Project officials were asked to keep the Chinese nationals, who will return from China soon, quarantined for two weeks and they have written to the civil surgeons of the districts where they were living to keep continuous watch, he told reporters at the press conference.

The press conference was arranged to announce that BR is going to increase the number of trips between Bangladesh and India from next week.

Similar steps have been taken for Chinese nationals involved in Chattogram to Cox’s Bazar (Ramu) Rail Link project, he added.

The ministers and the senior secretary made the comments when there is an apprehension that work on several mega development projects may be hampered if the coronavirus situation does not improve soon.

Many Chinese nationals working under those projects are now home on leave to celebrate the Chinese New Year. Given the situation in China, they might not be able to return and join work on time, said officials linked to the projects.

Several hundred Chinese nationals working in many of the projects have had their leaves extended and there could be further extension. Besides, several other project authorities were mulling similar steps, they said.

The projects include Padma Bridge, Padma Bridge Rail Link, Payra 1320MW Thermal Power Plant, Chattogram to Cox’s Bazar (Ramu) Rail Link, construction of a tunnel under the Karnaphuli river, and upgrading the Dhaka Bypass Road.

The seventh strain of the coronavirus was first detected in China’s Wuhan city in December. At least 492 people have died with more than 25,000 confirmed cases around the world.

Obaidul Quader said 332 out of 980 Chinese nationals working for the Padma Bridge project went on leave. Thirty-three of them returned, of whom eight completed the quarantine period while the rest are on observation.

“Our works will go on if their leave is not prolonged,” he added.

The headquarters of China Major Bridge Engineering Co Ltd, which is implementing the bridge, is in the Wuhan city, the epicentre of the outbreak.

Quader said 38 Chinese nationals are involved with the construction work of the Dhaka Elevated Expressway Project. Of them, 18 are on leave. “This will not create any problem,” he added.

He said 71 Chinese nationals are involved with the Bus Rapid Transit project. Of them, only one went on leave, while 31 out of 58 Chinese nationals, involved in the Metro Rail project, went on leave. “Their absence would not create any problem in the progress of the projects,” he claimed.

Quader also said that he has given directives to the Roads and Highways Department to cancel work orders of contractors if they failed to complete the work on time and if necessary, blacklist them.

He said the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority would collect 4 lakh licences from Bangladesh Machine Tools Factory as interim measures as a tender process in this regard has been cancelled over some allegations."	https://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/news/outbreak-could-delay-padma-bridge-project-1864000
Delayed	"Even though the progress of some mega projects involving China and Japan has slowed down amid the ongoing coronavirus situation, Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen has said the projects will be completed on time.

""The projects [speed] have slowed now due to coronavirus. I have talked to the Chinese and Japanese ambassadors. They said after the pandemic, they will double the efforts and ensure completion of the projects on time,"" Momen told journalists at his residence yesterday.

There has been some apprehension that projects like the Padma Bridge and Metro Rail will be delayed as the activities for those have stalled due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Some of the Japanese project officials have returned home due to the government-declared general holiday, but they will return immediately after it is over, the minister said.

He also informed that some of the OECD countries, including Australia and UK, want regular operations of the flights. Especially, the UK has been requesting for flight operations from Bangladesh to Manchester and London routes.

Presently, all flights of Biman Bangladesh Airlines have been suspended.

Last week, the US had chartered a flight for repatriation of nearly 300 of its citizens, including some diplomats and their families.

Another chartered flight with US citizens will leave Bangladesh tomorrow.

UK had also asked its citizens in Bangladesh to return due to the virus outbreak, but many got stuck after Biman suspended its flight operations to London and Manchester last week.

Asked if Bangladesh is considering to resume regular flights to London and Manchester, Momen said a committee comprised of officials from the Prime Minister's Office, and foreign and civil aviation ministries will take a decision in this regard.

""But many expatriate Bangladeshis are saying that it will not be the right decision to resume regular flights at this moment for health reasons,"" he told journalists.

He pointed out that the initial infection of coronavirus was imported from abroad. If regular flights start now, there will be more people coming and it may not be a wise decision, he said.

The countries that are seeking operation of regular flights themselves have suspended incoming or outbound flight operations, the foreign minister added."	https://www.thedailystar.net/coronavirus-deadly-new-threat/news/mega-projects-involving-china-japan-be-completed-time-momen-1889758

VIENTIANE, Aug. 16 (Xinhua) -- Baly Sipaseuth, 38, a victim of last year's overwhelming flood caused by a dam collapse in southern Laos, has experienced an amazing year after joining the construction of the China-Laos railway, he told Xinhua recently.

""I am Baly. I have been employed to work for CREC-2 (China Railway No. 2 Group) Laos-China Railway Vientiane Beam Fabrication Yard around one year. Just now I got my monthly salary,"" Baly said.

""One year ago, because of the dam collapse in Attapeu, all of my crops and livestock were destroyed by the flood,"" he said.

On July 23, 2018, the under-construction saddle dam of the Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy hydropower project collapsed, leading to a huge amount of water into 13 villages of the Sanamxay district of Attapeu province, some 560 km southeast of Vientiane. Six villages were severely damaged and 42 people lost their lives with 23 still unaccounted for. In total, 13,000 people were affected with over 6,000 people left homeless in the floods.

""In the event of emergency, the rescue teams from Laos-China Railway Project rushed to our village, and helped us construct the road and bridges,"" Baly said.

At the request of Lao government, the Chinese engineering companies, along the China-Laos railway construction sites, have donated cash and materials to the disaster-hit areas and offered assistance to build four bridges urgently for access to the flooded villages of Attapeu Province.

In less than 50 days, the CREC-2 and Sinohydro Bureau 10 under China Power, with guidance from the Laos-China Railway Company, completed the construction of four brand-new quality bridges in flooded Attapeu. To honor the achievement and contribution of the Chinese engineering companies, Lao Prime Minister Thongloun Sisoulith signed an order of commendation for the Laos-China Railway Company, CREC-2 and China Power. On behalf of the government, Lao Minister of Public Works and Transport Bounchan Sinthavong conferred development medals to the three companies last September.

""When they left, they asked me whether we would go with them to work in Vientiane. Then, we got to know the Laos-China Railway, but we didn't know what it meant at that time actually, and we didn't know what the future will become,"" Baly said.

""However, most of us registered positively, Because we knew, there were jobs, and there's the hope.""

""I could only do some easy work at the beginning. After we were familiar with the work environment, the project management department organized us for training, taught us to fabricate the T-shaped beam, and taught us the safety regulations. Because I have never had such kind of experience before, and also because of the language and communication problem, I felt really difficult,"" Baly added.

""The Chinese technicians instructed us with patience, I gradually understood our work, and I have fitted in with my work. Now, like our Chinese friends, I can finish some procedures alone. And I begin to teach my skills to other Lao workers.""

""The T-shaped beam is adopted in Laos-China Railway Project. The temperature is really high during the daytime, so we can only start the work from afternoon till the midnight with our Chinese friends.""

""It's really amazing to construct the railway, but it is also a kind of rigorous work. I am responsible for the concrete casting. It looks simple, but if there is any negligence and oversight, the whole process of beam-making will be delayed. It may even affect the quality of T-shaped beams.""

""A lot of people had no work, like me before. They can only catch some game on the hill or fish in the river for sale. The income can only afford the repairing motorcycle and daily living expenses.""

""Wages here are much higher than before. I also used my savings to buy a new cell phone. I don't need to borrow a friend's cell phone to call home anymore. I have been here more than one year. The new house at home is almost ready to be built. I cherish this job very much.""

""We live and work with our Chinese friends, and watch Jackie Chan's Films. We also have a special window for Lao cuisine at the project, and take shower with hot water everyday. I learned from my Chinese friends that the China Railway No.2 Group has built many high-speed railway and high buildings in China, very beautiful. After the opening of this railway, I hope to take my family to China for a visit,"" Baly said.

Many Lao people are like Baly, with dreams and hopes. They are connected with the Chinese constructor in Laos-China Railway. This railway bears the friendship, and the hope of the Lao and Chinese people.

The China-Laos railway, with a length of over 414 km, links Mohan-Boten border gate in northern Laos and capital Vientiane. Operating speed on the route is designed at 160 km per hour.

As the first overseas route connecting with the railway system in China using Chinese technology and equipment, China-Laos railway is a major strategic project which was reached and promoted by top leaders of the two countries, a major project in infrastructure inter-connectivity between China and neighboring countries, and a major project in implementing the Belt and Road Initiative.

Ground-breaking ceremony of the railway was held in December 2015, and the construction of the whole route officially started a year later."	http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-08/16/c_138313585.htm
Delayed	"People’s wait for the Padma bridge is going to get longer as the authorities now seek to extend the deadline for one and a half years.

The new deadline to complete the work will be June 2021; currently it is December this year. This is the fourth time the deadline is being changed.

However, the authorities did not seek escalation of the project cost, which is Tk 30,193 crore, officials said.

The Bridges Division, the implementing authority of the project, in September sent a proposal to the planning ministry, seeking extension of time.

And the Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation Division (IMED), after a recent spot visit recommended the time extension with some conditions.

“We will now place the proposal before the Ecnec [Executive Committee of National Economic Council] meeting for approval soon,” a planning ministry official told this newspaper, seeking anonymity.

“The delay in handing over the pile design [to the contractor] is the main reason for the change in the schedule,” Project Director Shafiqul Islam told The Daily Star yesterday.

He declined to give further details.

Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader said on August 29 that the movement of vehicles on the Padma bridge would begin by June 2021.

On Tuesday, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, replying to a query at a press conference, said it was not possible to give a specific timeframe for completion of the construction which is a highly technical work.

Prof Jamilur Reza Choudhury, chairman of the government’s panel of experts on the Padma bridge, told The Daily Star yesterday, “We hope that the work of the project will be completed within the new timeframe if no major problem arises.”

However, the contractor would have to considerably speed up the work and deploy additional manpower and equipment, he said.

Currently, the national professor observed, only two spans are installed in a month and it would be difficult to complete the work within the timeframe at this speed.

Asked whether the project cost may escalate further, he said “It would depend on the price of the key materials including fuel, stone, steel, rods, cements and skilled labourers.

“If prices of the ingredients go up, the cost of the project will increase further. If the prices go down, the project cost will decrease.”

Two major components of the project are the main bridge and river training.

Eighty-four percent work of the main bridge is done while 63 percent work of river training have been completed till September, according to the project documents.

The first span was installed on September 30, 2017. The Padma bridge will have total 41 spans.

Around 2,250-metre stretch of the bridge is now visible as the 15th span (superstructure) was installed on October 22.

Once constructed, the bridge will directly connect the capital to 21 southern districts, through road and railways.

REASONS BEHIND DELAYS

IMED, in its report, mentioned four reasons behind the delay -- two reasons each relating to the main bridge and river training.

The authorities have to redesign piles of 22 piers, out of 40, as differences emerged between the information obtained through geotechnical investigation in the design phase and construction phase.

The authorities failed to place the design of the piles of piers on right time and this contributed to the delay.

The report also pointed to the delay in pile re-designing that also deferred the construction of span (steel truss), the report said.

Strong currents in the Padma in 2015 created two huge scours (erosion hole) in the river, forcing the authorities to change work for slope protection, causing six months’ delay.

The contractor could not complete the river training on time due to strong current, it also mentioned.

However, the complications over the piers have been addressed.

The IMED in the report gave several conditions, including preparing a new work plan for the fresh deadline and ensuring timely disbursement of money.

BACKGROUND

A feasibility study on the project was conducted with assistance from Japan International Cooperation Agency (Jica) from 2003 to 2005. The original cost was estimated in 2007 on the basis of the study.

Then cost was Tk 10,161 crore. However, it did not include the cost of railway lines on the bridge.

With financing from the Asian Development Bank, the work on a detailed design of the bridge had started in 2009.

The cost almost doubled to Tk 20,507 crore when the first revision was done in 2011, including the cost of the railway lines.

According to the first revision, the project was scheduled to be completed in 2015.

The authorities in 2015 revised the project cost by 40 percent, raising the estimated cost to Tk 28,793 crore. The deadline for completion of the project was extended to 2018.

Later, the deadline was extended to December 2019 and the cost shot up to 30,193 crores to acquire additional land last year.

The World Bank withdrew its $1.2 billion loan in 2012 over the allegations of corruption conspiracies, which the government always strongly rejected.

The country then moved to build the bridge with its own funds."	https://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/news/padma-bridge-wait-now-gets-even-longer-1821448
Delayed	"The cost of land acquisition for the Padma Bridge Rail Link Project is set to go up by Tk 780 crore, which is likely to escalate the project costs.

Of the amount, the government will spend around Tk 130 crore for acquiring around 100 more acres of private land for “some changes in route alignment” and pay Tk 650 crore to several government bodies, including the Roads and Highways Department (RHD) and the Bangladesh Bridge Authority (BBA), for using their land.

Project officials, however, said they would manage the additional money for land acquisition from the project’s existing funds and thus no additional funds would be required “at least for now”.

The fresh escalation in costs came around one and a half years after the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) approved the revised Development Project Proforma (DPP). At that time, the costs rose by more than Tk 4,200 crore as land acquisition expenditures escalated and project implementation got delayed.

The project costs climbed to Tk 39,246 crore from the original costs of Tk 34,989 crore.

The Ecnec also extended two years for completing the project, setting the new deadline to June 2024.

Besides, the government has to spend more than Tk 100 crore from its own funds to provide project employees with facilities as Exim Bank of China, the lone lender of the project, has declined to fund this.

Project Director Golam Fakhruddin Ahmed Chowdhury, however, said, “Additional money would not be required [for the project] for at least two or three years.”

There were some initial problems in the project, but those were overcome. The work has gained momentum, with 22 percent physical progress till December last year, he told The Daily Star on Sunday.

Another official said the project costs will not increase for acquiring more land as the money would come from the existing allocation, but the costs might rise for some other reasons like extending stations size.

“The money could have been used for other purposes if we had not needed to buy the new land,” the official said, wishing anonymity.

THE RAIL LINK PROJECT

The Ecnec in May 2016 approved the “Padma Bridge Rail Link Project” to connect the capital with Jashore with a 169km double-track rail line over the under-construction Padma Bridge.

But the loan agreement with China was delayed.

In April 2018, the Economic Relations Division inked a Tk 21,036 crore loan agreement with Exim Bank of China, and physical work of the project finally started in October 2018.

Now, it takes more than nine hours to travel the 412km from Dhaka to Khulna, but once the project is completed, the distance would be reduced to 213km and it would take four hours.

At least 23km of the rail line would be elevated. The total rail route would have 66 major and 244 minor bridges, a highway overpass and 40 underpasses, 29 level crossings, and 20 stations.

Apart from the new acquisition plan, the authorities have to acquire 1,786 acres of private land and around 340 acres of different government agencies, including the RHD and the BBA. They have so far acquired around 1,700 acres, a project official said.

WHY ADDITIONAL LAND?

Project Director Fakhruddin said they have to acquire around 100 acres of land for the first phase from Dhaka to Faridpur’s Bhanga.

“We may not require to buy more land for other phases,” he said.

A Bangladesh Railway official, wishing anonymity, said they acquired per acre of land for the project cost at an average of Tk 1.28 crore and that the costs of 100 acres would be around Tk 130 crore.

They would acquire land from Dhaka, Narayanganj, Munshiganj, Shariatpur, Madaripur, and Faridpur for the first phase.

The official added that they would have to acquire more land due to changes in the route alignment.

Asked about the prime minister’s directives to set up the rail track with the option of the electric traction system so that electric trains could be used in future, the project director said they were now conducting a study on the proposal.

Usually, a government agency would acquire other government agency’s land giving token money or without any cost.

In this case, the project authorities have to acquire land of different government agencies at full price.

“So, now we have to pay Tk 650 crore for government agencies’ land acquisition,” Fakhruddin said.

From now on, a government agency will have to pay the same amount to acquire land from another government agency or a private owner, said another railway official.

Exim Bank would provide Tk 21,036 crore as loan for the project, while the government will provide Tk 18,210 crore.

The government plans to open the 42km stretch of the rail line from Mawa to Bhanga over the Padma bridge by June 2021 when the long-cherished bridge is expected to be opened for vehicles.

The physical work of the rail route suffered a setback due to problems in the design of piles of viaducts on both sides of the bridge and a huge amount of allocated money for the project was refunded in the last fiscal year.

“Like many other mega projects, we faced hurdles at initial stages, but we have been able to overcome those and make a significant progress,” he said."	https://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/padma-bridge-rail-link-project-land-acquisition-could-drive-cost-1854178
Delayed	"The newly installed 15th span of the Padma multipurpose bridge Dhaka Tribune

Humayun Kabir, assistant engineer of Padma Bridge (main bridge), confirmed the matter to the Dhaka Tribune

The 15th span of the Padma multipurpose bridge was installed at the Zajira point on Tuesday.

Humayun Kabir, assistant engineer of Padma Bridge (main bridge), confirmed the matter to the Dhaka Tribune.

He said: “With the installation of the 15th span on its 23rd and 24th pillars, the construction work of 2250 meters, of the country’s largest bridge, has been completed so far .

However, the installation of the 15th span of the bridge was delayed due to inclement weather and rainy season,” he added. The engineer also said that many times work gets delayed because of the large amount of silt stuck in the river, hindering the crane’s navigation.

According to a report, work for the Jazeera and Mawa connecting road and service area-2 has been completed ,and 169,000 trees have been planted on either side of the bridge. A museum is also being set up in the nearby area.

The government has, till June, given nearly Tk 6.42 billion in compensation to those who sustained damages during construction. Moreover, 2,690 land plots have been handed over to families in the repatriation area, and 697 homeless families were given plots for free.

According to experts, the national economy is expected to witness 1.2 percent GDP growth rate, while 0.84 percent poverty will be reduced every year.

The state-funded 9.83 km bridge will cost approximately Tk 301.93 billion for construction, and so far the progress of the project is at 74 percent."	https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/nation/2019/10/22/padma-bridge-s-15th-span-installed-2250-meters-now-evident
Delayed	"The U.S. Bureau of Land Management said it continues to work on issuing a permit for a $1 billion solar power project in Nevada, after already missing two deadlines to move the project forward.

The proposed 690-MW Gemini solar farm in Nevada is one of the country’s largest proposed solar projects. It would be operated by NV Energy, a subsidiary of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., and is being developed by California-based Arevia Power and Houston, Texas-based private equity firm Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners.

Arevia said it has been hopeful regulators would quickly issue a decision, but an official with the company in a statement April 2 suggested the COVID-19 pandemic might have delayed action.

“In the current circumstances impacting federal government priorities, it would be prudent not to speculate,” Arevia Managing Partner Ricardo Graf said in an email to media. He said he did not expect the delay to impact the project’s qualification for a federal tax credit. “Gemini’s status is not predicated on full-scale construction commencing this year,” he said.

BLM spokeswoman Kirsten Cannon told Reuters this week the bureau does not have a timeframe for a decision, but she said the agency was moving “expeditiously” to finish its work. NV Energy has said it still expects the project to come online in 2023, its original timeline.

Kristen Saibini, a spokeswoman for NV Energy, told Reuters on Thursday: “The Gemini Solar project is a large, important part of our future renewable portfolio and we look forward to their successful on-time completion.”

Section 106 Permit Needed

NV Energy in December 2019 secured approval from the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada (PUCN) for about 1.20 GW of new solar projects, along with 590 MW of energy storage capacity. Gemini is one of the projects that was approved; the project is expected to be coupled with a 380-MW battery storage system.

NV Energy has been rapidly expanding its solar power portfolio, with several projects planned across Nevada.

The BLM needs to issue a Section 106 permit for the Gemini project. That permit, part of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA), requires federal agencies to consider the effects of a project “on historic properties of projects they carry out, assist, fund, permit, license, or approve throughout the country.” The Section 106 review occurs when a project assisted by the federal government—in this case a project on federal lands—could affect historic properties.

A draft agreement filed between the BLM and the Nevada State Historic Preservation Office says the project covers 7,100 acres of federal land near Las Vegas. The draft says the project would have a visual impact on a historic railroad camp on the Moapa River Indian Reservation. It also could impact the Old Spanish National Historic Trail, used by early settlers moving through the area in 1830s to 1860s. The Section 106 review allows public comment on project impacts to historic areas prior to a final decision.

A review of the project originally was expected to be completed by year-end 2019, and then was expected again prior to the end of March. The BLM under the Obama administration had previously rejected the project under an agreement with conservation groups, a deal that protected sensitive desert land from solar and wind power development. The Trump administration in February 2018 indicated it would dismiss that agreement.

Solar Plus Storage

NV Energy previously said the Gemini solar-plus-storage project will cost about $38.44 per megawatt-hour under a 25-year contract. Gemini would mark at least the third time the Trump administration’s BLM has approved a solar power project on federal lands. The agency approved an 80-MW project in Wyoming in June 2018, as well as a 550-MW solar farm near Joshua Tree National Park in California in November 2018.

The BLM released its final environmental impact statement for Gemini in January of this year. At the time, BLM Southern Nevada District Manager Tim Smith in a statement said, “The proposed Gemini Solar Project would represent a significant increase in renewable energy capacity for Nevada and the West. The BLM actively supports the Department of the Interior’s America First Energy Plan, an ‘all of the above’ strategy which supports energy development on public lands.”

Delayed	"Homes under construction for villagers who have been forced to relocate for the railway in Kasi district, Vientiane province, Laos.

Many Lao villagers who were forced to relocate for construction on the Laos-China railway are still waiting for compensation from the government, while others who have received payments say the payments are much lower than they had expected.

The railway project linking landlocked Laos with China has been touted as a benefit to the Lao economy because it will lower the cost of exports and consumer goods while boosting socioeconomic development in the impoverished nation of nearly 7 million people.

The section of railway between Luang Namtha and the capital Vientiane is more than 70 percent complete, which bodes well for the project finishing on schedule in 2021, but villagers who had to give up their houses and land in the name of progress have been waiting for payments from the government, which have been repeatedly delayed.

A villager from Luang Prabang province’s Xiang Ngeun district told RFA’s Lao Service on July 12 that she doesn’t see a future where she and her neighbors will actually receive compensation because it’s been two years since they lost their farmlands.

She said the government went back on its promise of a swift transfer of funds into the villagers’ newly opened bank accounts.

“We haven’t received any compensation from the railway project,” she said.

“I already opened a bank account but no money has been deposited yet. [We the villagers] are waiting but we’ve received nothing,” said the villager.

She said that officials came to meet with the villagers and promised to pay them by the end of June, so they were hopeful that their situation would be resolved, but it is now well into July and they have still received nothing.

She said that the villagers asked district officials again when they could receive payment, and the officials told them to keep waiting and they would receive their money soon.

An official of Xiang Ngeun district said the compensation committee is in the process of preparing compensation for the affected villagers.

“Up until now we have received three payments. We need two more [to have enough funds] to complete the whole compensation,” said the official.

“Our next compensation will be more than 11 billion kip [about $1.26 million] for approximately 30 families. Right now, we’re waiting for approval from the central government,” the official said.

However, the official did not answer how many affected villagers have received compensation and how many remain without payments.

Meanwhile, in Vientiane province’s Hin Heub district, displaced villagers who have received compensation are complaining that it is not enough to cover the expenses of building a new house.

“They gave us only a little bit more than 100 million kip, [less than $12,000], but with just 100 million, we can’t build a new home,” said a Hin Heub resident who heads a family of five.

The man said that he is building his new house by himself, but cannot finish it with just the money the government gave to him. In its current state, whenever it rains he must take his family to hide somewhere else, because the roof leaks.

“The land for our new home was given to us by my grandfather. If we would’ve had to have bought the land then we wouldn’t have any money left to build the house. The compensation we were paid is far less than the 200 [million kip, about $24,000] we expected,” he said.

“We said to the developer that we’d be happy to move for 200, but that’s not what we got,” the man said.

The villager said his case is not unique, and he knows of others who are also not happy with the compensation they received because it was much lower than what they were expecting.

He said they have no choice other than to accept the compensation because the alternative is to receive nothing, while still losing their land and houses.

“We can’t oppose [the government]. We did whatever the project wanted us to do. My new house is not complete; we have to rely on ourselves and work harder to make enough money to complete it,” said the villager.

A Hin Heub district official confirmed that many of the affected families in the district have received compensation and officials are working to complete all compensation claims before mid-2021.

“The project affects 11 villages in total. So far we’ve compensated five,” the official said.

“But that figure is based on initial information. We have new information because in some places the project has changed in scope. According to the new information, we don’t know yet how many more villagers have been compensated because it hasn’t been concluded,” said the official.

According to data collected by RFA’s Lao Service, 138 affected families received compensation in Luang Namtha district, Luang Namtha province, with more 18 in Xai district, Oudomxay province and 38 in Luang Prabang district in Luang Prabang province.

Some of RFA’s figures list villages as having received compensation without listing the number of families. According to the data, 23 villages in Luang Prabang and Vientiane provinces, and 2 in Vientiane capital have received compensation.

RFA’s Lao Service attempted to contact Rattanamany Khounnivong, vice minister at the Lao Ministry of Public Works and Transport, on July 12 and 15 but were unable to reach him.

Delayed	"The coronavirus outbreak could impede the construction of Beijing-backed infrastructure projects across Bangladesh, officials said, amid reports that thousands of Chinese working on them have been stranded in China as a result, after going home for Lunar New Year festivities.

Bangladeshi health authorities so far have confirmed no cases of anyone being infected with the novel coronavirus in the South Asian country, but four construction workers from Bangladesh have been diagnosed with the virus in Singapore, the Ministry of Health in the city-state said Thursday.

“If the coronavirus situation does not improve, we will face problems,” Md Shafiqul Islam, project director of the Padma Bridge , Bangladesh’s largest-ever infrastructure construction project, told BenarNews, an RFA-affiliated online news service, this week. “It will exert a negative impact.”

Although construction on the bridge is ongoing, he was pointing to how the outbreak has reduced the size of the overall workforce, which relies heavily on Chinese workers, and slowed the progress of such mega-infrastructure projects in recent weeks.

Chinese engineers and laborers who work on those projects have been blocked from returning to Bangladesh as a result of travel restrictions imposed by Beijing during the outbreak, Islam and other officials said.

The outbreak of the virus, whose epicenter is in Wuhan, China, could further delay the U.S.$1.1 billion road-and-rail bridge across the Padma River – which was already behind schedule –and slow other Chinese-linked infrastructure projects pushed by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her Awami League party, officials said.

Meanwhile, at least 45,000 people have been diagnosed with the virus in 25 countries and more than 1,100 people have died from it, according to latest information from the World Health Organization (WHO).

Most of the infections and deaths have occurred in China. The U.N. agency has declared the outbreak a global emergency, and is now classifying the mystery virus as Coronavirus Disease 2019, or COVID-19.

Islam said about 1,000 Chinese nationals were employed as engineers or construction workers on the Padma Bridge alone, but the outbreak came as China and Chinese communities worldwide celebrated the arrival of the Year of the Rat. Lunar New Year festivities involve the largest annual migration of humans within mainland China and to and from the world’s most populous nation.

“Nearly 250 of them [bridge workers] have gone back to China for holiday making. But the Chinese government barred them from leaving China,” Islam said, adding he was also concerned about the timely arrival of construction supplies from Beijing.

“If the consignment does not arrive, we will face a shortage of supplies,” he said.

Impact on other projects

Elsewhere, Khurshedul Alam, the acting managing director of a joint venture building a $2.5 billion power plant near the Payra port south of Dhaka, confirmed that the project’s commissioning had also been delayed because Chinese construction workers had been blocked from re-entering Bangladesh.

“We can’t do the post-test-run maintenance as some workers are stuck in China in the wake of the coronavirus epidemic,” Alam told the Business Standard newspaper.

Obaidul Quader, Bangladesh’s minister for road transport and bridges, told reporters last week that construction of key projects could hit a snag if the virus outbreak lasted for more than two months.

“There would be some problems if it lingers for three to four months,” he said.

Quader said 332 of the Chinese nationals working at the Padma Bridge had left for China.

“Only 33 of the 332 people returned,” he said. “Eight of the 33 returnees are out of quarantine. Others remain in quarantine.”

Chinese construction companies, including the China Major Bridge Engineering Corporation, are building the 6.1-km (3.8-mile) Padma Bridge, which would connect the capital Dhaka with 21 southwestern and south-central districts.

The project appears to be behind schedule, but Islam, the project director, told BenarNews that engineers had installed 24 of the total 41 spans required to finish the project. Once complete, it would connect the capital Dhaka with Bangladesh’s central and southwestern districts.

Nurul Islam Sujan, Bangladesh’s railways minister, said the virus could also impact construction of a rail link that 878 Chinese nationals were rushing to connect with the Padma Bridge.

“China is a major development partner of Bangladesh, so it [coronavirus] would impact both Bangladesh and China,” Sujan told reporters.

Last week, Li Jiming, the Chinese ambassador to Dhaka, told reporters that about 8,000 Chinese nationals work at infrastructure projects in Bangladesh and about two-thirds of them had travelled to China for Chinese new year celebrations. None of them had tested positive for the virus, he said.

“Let general people be alert but don’t create panic,” the envoy said. “No panic, no rumor and be rational.”

Analyst: Virus could bring ‘bigger economic consequences’

China is also one of Bangladesh’s largest trading partners, registering annual bilateral trade of about $12 billion, with the imbalance tilted heavily in Beijing’s favor.

According to Mostafizur Rahman, a scholar at the think-tank Center for Policy Dialogue, the virus could deliver an economic shock to Bangladesh, because local workers have expressed concerns that they could get infected by working with the Chinese, an undetermined number of whom had been placed under quarantine by Bangladeshi authorities.

“The extent of negative economic impact in Bangladesh caused by coronavirus will depend on the prolongation of the epidemic,” he said. “We may face bigger economic consequences.”

Delayed	"The Gemini Solar project was so close to getting fully approved for construction — but the U.S. Bureau of Land Management missed the date to decide the project’s Section 106 permit, which was supposed to be given out in March. Now, Gemini, anticipated to be the largest solar installation in the country upon completion, waits in limbo.

Just as every proposed solar project must go through an environmental impact study, the Section 106 permit is one that evaluates a project’s historic impact. The land proposed for the 690 MW proposed giant is on the Moapa River Indian Reservation, 33 miles northeast of Las Vegas. The concern is over the project’s visual impact on an historic railroad camp, as well as the Old Spanish National Historic Trail.

The Old Spanish National Historic Trail was used by settlers in the 1830s to 1860s to bring goods from Santa Fe, New Mexico, to Los Angeles, California. Along the way, these settlers would also trade with the local Native American groups that they encountered. The trail is lauded for making Santa Fe the hub of the overland continental trade between Mexico and United States, and for the story of two toddlers traversing the trail while packed into mule saddlebags.

In response to the delay, BLM has shared that the organization can no longer give a timeframe for a decision, but a spokesperson told Reuters that the bureau is working “expeditiously” to finish the work.

Developer Arevia Power shared with Reuters that the project’s permit decision may have been pushed back as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, but gave no concrete reasoning.

The project is still anticipated to be completed in 2023, and will feature a mammoth 380 MW/1,520 MWh lithium-ion battery, one of the largest known to pv magazine.

Delayed	"File photo of Payra Power Plant UNB

The PGCB and the government has jointly funded the project

A 400KV Payra–Gopalganj power transmission line has gone into operation with a hope that it will facilitate the power supply from newly constructed 1st unit of 1200MW Payra Coal-fired Power Plant.

In a statement, state-owned Power Grid Company of Bangladesh (PGCB) on Tuesday said the 163km double circuit grid transmission line was commissioned at 4:52pm by transmitting 400KV electricity from Gopalganj grid substation at Moksedpur upazila of Gopalganj district, reports UNB.

The important transmission line was scheduled to come into operation in the first half of the year of 2019. But, it missed a number of deadlines for various reasons.

The main target of the project was to supply power from the 600MW 1st unit of Payra Power Plant which was installed and commissioned a few months ago.

But, the power transmission was not possible from the plant because of the delay in implementation of the transmission project.

“Electricity from Payra Power Plant will be supplied through the newly constructed transmission line,” the Electricity Generation Company of Bangladesh Ltd (EGCB) said, adding that the four ultra-modern Aluminium Conductor Composite Core (ACCC) conductors (cable) were used in each phase of the transmission line.

Since the line is of high capacity, it will be capable of transmitting more electricity from other power plants to the setups in future in the region, it added.

The new power line crossed different areas, including Patuakhali Sadar, Barguna, Jhalakati, Barisal and Madaripur, starting from the Payra Power Plant.

The PGCB informed that it required crossing four rivers -- Payra, Sandha, Sugandha and Laukhali - to complete the construction of the long transmission line.

A number of long towers were installed at both ends of each river to complete the job.

South Korean contractor GS Engineering and Construction Corporation constructed the transmission line on a turnkey basis at a cost of Tk1,412 crore.

The PGCB implemented the scheme under its “Patuakhali-Gopalganj 400KV Transmission Line and Gopalganj 400KV Grid Substation Project”.

The PGCB and the government jointly funded the project.

North-West Power Generation Company Ltd (NWPGCL) Managing Director Khursedul Alm had said once the transmission line was commissioned, it would require 15 days more to supply power from the Payra plant."	https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/nation/2019/12/31/payra-gopalganj-power-transmission-line-goes-into-operation
Delayed	"DHAKA (Reuters) - The construction of a $2.5 billion power plant in Bangladesh, a joint venture with China, will be delayed after critical equipment was stolen or destroyed during clashes between workers at the site this week, a senior official said on Sunday.

A Chinese worker was killed and at least six injured on Wednesday when violence erupted between Bangladeshi and Chinese construction workers at the plant, with the former angered by the death of a colleague in a fall.

Abdul Mowla, general manager of the Bangladesh-China Power Co Ltd (BCPCL), which is 50:50 funded by China and Bangladesh, said as a result of the damage the coal-based 1,320 megawatt power plant would not come on line early next year as planned.

He said he did not know the new target date for the plant, which is being constructed near the port of Payra 200 miles (320 km) from Dhaka.

A Siemens-produced directive control system, the equivalent of the brains of the facility, has gone missing, Mowla said.

Cranes were also inactive at the site, as a hydraulics system has been disabled and needs foreign experts to be brought in to get it working again, he added.

Mowla said a “huge” amount of destruction inside the plant had resulted from the clashes.

There have been tensions between Chinese and local workers in a number of parts of south and southeast Asia in recent years as China has increased its investments in infrastructure as part of its Belt and Road trade and growth initiative.

Construction of the coal-fired plant employs about 8,000 workers, of whom 2,700 are Chinese.

Mowla said that the full cost of the destruction and delays has yet to be ascertained.

The company has sent its Bangladeshi workers off on 15 days’ leave, effective from Sunday, while the site is cleaned up, he said.

All the Chinese workers are living in the dormitories inside the plant premises and their safety has been ensured, Mowla added. Some of them have been engaged in the clean-up.

Monirul Islam, the officer in charge of Kalapara police station, said that 16 Bangladeshi workers have been arrested.

The company has filed a case with police, saying that around 600 workers were involved in committing offences, though it hasn’t named them."	https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bangladesh-china-workers/chinese-funded-power-plant-in-bangladesh-delayed-after-workers-clash-idUSKCN1TO0GQ
Delayed	India’s bullet train project is moving at the pace of a commuter train instead.A year after the project was kicked off, only 0.9 hectares of land have been acquired out of the 1,400 hectares needed, according to the Indian government company leading the project. The $15 billion facility, the highlight of Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s drive to upgrade infrastructure, is facing resistance from farmers unhappy with the compensation for land taken away from them.The planned 316-mile line linking the financial capital of Mumbai with the economic hub of Ahmedabad -- roughly the distance between Los Angeles and San Francisco -- was meant to be a big leap from the trains of Indian Railways , Asia’s oldest network with over 165 years of history. At the current rate of land acquisition, the bullet train built with Japan’s ‘ Shinkansen ’ technology risks missing its 2023 completion target.“Land acquisition is a very common problem in India and many projects are delayed, there’s no question about that,” said Raghbendra Jha, an economics professor at the Australian National University. “I’ve seen many instances like this.”The protests highlight the challenge Modi faces in implementing his flagship projects across railways, ports and airports to cement India’s position as world’s fastest growing economy. Projects worth 754 billion rupees ($10.2 billion) were completed in the quarter ended September 2018, less than half of the targeted 2 trillion rupees, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy.“The project is very high-level and highly visible, publicity-wise,” said Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, a political analyst and author of a biography on Modi. “If people are beginning to protest, this is going to undermine Mr. Modi’s image as someone who can implement things very seamlessly.”For Japanese suppliers to the bullet train such as East Japan Railway Co., Hitachi Ltd. and Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd., the Indian project was a big victory over China’s CRRC Corp., Siemens AG and Bombardier Inc. After years of international marketing, India became a rare buyer for the Shinkansen.A group of farmers affected by the project have petitioned the Gujarat High Court, which has sought the government’s stand on the plea on Nov. 22, according to court documents. The farmers have also questioned the government’s power to acquire farm land for public-private partnership projects, documents show.The courts had earlier refused to put the land acquisition process on hold.The National High Speed Rail Corporation , which is building the Indian project, said there are no funding gaps despite the delay in land acquisition. The date of operation for the project will be in August 2022, said Dhananjay Kumar, a spokesman for the company, a year before its official completion target. The company is “committed to take care of the interests of the affected farmers,” he said.Farmer protests have stalled projects in India in the past. A decade back, Tata Motors Ltd. had to delay selling the world’s cheapest car, the Nano, after violent protest by farmers forced the owner of Jaguar Land Rover to abandon a factory in the state of West Bengal and instead choose a new site in western Gujarat. Land acquisition has also been an issue in the potential construction of an oil refinery with Saudi Aramco in Maharashtra.India isn’t the only country where a planned bullet train has struggled to take off because of land acquisition problems.A $6 billion high-speed rail project connecting Jakarta and Bandung is entangled in Indonesia’s infamous red tape and difficulties in acquiring land for the project. While construction was meant to begin in August 2016, only 7.6 percent of the work has been done on the 142-kilometer railway line at the end of August, according to the Jakarta Post.For Shailesh Kumar, director for Asia at political risk consultancy Eurasia Group, land acquisition is “an eternal story” in India. “But I have a suspicion that once the bullet train is there, and users accept it, you’ll see massive expansion,” he said.The official target for completion is 2023. India says it will attempt to have it running a year earlier Total estimated cost is 1.08 trillion rupees While the train is designed to run at 350 kilometers per hour, it will operate at a maximum speed of 320 kilometers (200 miles per hour), cutting down travel time between the two cities to about two hours from about seven hours Most of the corridor will be elevated, but will include a 21-kilometer tunnel with seven kilometers under the Arabian Sea.	https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/railways/indias-200-miles-per-hour-bullet-train-has-starting-trouble/articleshow/66254543.cms?from=mdr
Delayed	"KUALA LUMPUR (THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - There will still be no decision on Thursday (Oct 31) by the Malaysian government on the Rapid Transit System (RTS) Link project.

Despite the pressing need for the proposed Johor Baru-Singapore connection and the possibility of a hefty compensation payable to Singapore, Malaysia is seeking another six-month extension to review the RM4 billion (S$1.3 billion) project.

This is the third request for more time.

The initial six-month grace period approved by Singapore expired on Sept 30.

This was followed by a one-month extension granted by the republic, which meant that the Malaysian government was to have made a decision by Thursday.

The extra time was given without Singapore making any financial demands over the delay in the project.

Officials told The Star that the latest request for a six-month extension was made known to Singapore on Monday - 48 hours before Thursday's deadline.

Transport Minister Anthony Loke said in a Facebook post that an announcement would be made by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad at 3pm on Thursday. He also questioned The Star's story: ""This is totally MISLEADING and unethical journalism! You run the front-page news based on unverified and unnamed sources?""

It was learnt that the Transport Ministry was still unable to resolve certain issues on its side, prompting the need for more time for the review.

These issues include the relocation of the RTS depot, currently proposed to be in Singapore, and the rail system to be used.

An official said Singapore could reserve the right to backdate claims for damages relating to the delay, or even reduce the review period sought by Malaysia.

Work on the 4km link was suspended in May.

The proposed RTS will use the same rolling stock and signalling system as Singapore's Thomson-East Coast line in the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system.

According to one official, some observers said that an MRT system was costlier to build and maintain, and Malaysia could be looking for a less sophisticated system to bring down the cost of the project.

Last month, The Star reported that Malaysia was studying the option of getting the private sector to fund and operate the RTS.

The request for a further extension is expected to set off a storm in Johor, where officials have been pressing for an expedited resolution to the issue due to worsening congestion at the Causeway.

At present, more than 367,000 people use the Customs, Immigration and Quarantine (CIQ) complex daily, with 254,000 of them at the Johor Baru side and 113,000 at the Second Link.

In unveiling Budget 2020 on Oct 11, Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng announced that the government would proceed with the RTS project.

Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad confirmed this but said ""it will take some time"".

Both governments signed a bilateral agreement last year to build the cross-border MRT link from Woodlands in Singapore to Bukit Chagar in Johor to help alleviate congestion at the Causeway.

Under the proposal, the RTS will have two stations, with the Singapore terminus located in Woodlands North and the Malaysia terminus in Bukit Chagar.

Both stations will have co-located Singaporean and Malaysian customs, immigration and quarantine facilities.

Initially targeted for completion by Dec 31, 2024, the RTS will be the second rail link between the two countries after the KTM Tebrau shuttle service.

However, the agreement with Singapore spells out that the KTM shuttle train service will have to cease operating within six months after the RTS starts operating.

Should Malaysia choose to scrap the RTS project, it may have to pay Singapore up to RM200 million for the preparatory work that the Republic has done on its side.

Delayed	"India’s top court will hear a group of farmers seeking to halt land acquisition for the South Asian nation’s maiden high-speed rail project, funded by Japan.

A two-judge bench headed by Justice Deepak Gupta issued a notice to the government on Friday seeking its view on the farmers’ petitions. The apex court will hear the case on March 20.

The court’s decision threatens to further delay the 508-kilometer (316 miles) rail project linking India’s financial capital Mumbai to Ahmedabad, the capital city of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s home state of Gujarat. Farmer protests over land acquisition is a recurring issue that has plagued infrastructure investments in India.

The farmers’ allegations that the land acquisition process for the project is illegal was rejected by a lower court in September, prompting them to move the top court.

Japan International Cooperation Agency had in 2017 agreed to fund most of the $17 billion needed for the project that will give a modern push to Asia’s oldest rail network.

Delayed	"BANGKOK, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The first phase of an 873-km (542 mile) high-speed railway between Thailand and China is expected to begin operating within four years, a senior government official said on Tuesday.

The first 252-km leg connecting the Thai capital, Bangkok, and the northeastern province of Nakhon Ratchasima will start service in 2023, deputy government spokeswoman Traisuree Taisaranakul told reporters.

Thailand will shoulder the total construction cost of 179 billion baht ($5.85 billion) for the first phase, with China responsible for installing systems, design and the procurement of trains, a government video released to reporters showed.

The project - part of China’s planned network of rail links across Southeast Asia that would eventually connect Kunming in southwest China with Singapore - was delayed in 2016 when Thailand rejected Chinese financing due to high interest rates.

The next phase of the line will connect Nakhon Ratchasima to Nong Khai province, which borders Laos and will eventually link up to China, Traisuree said.

Construction and bidding contracts will be finalized this year, Acting Governor State Railway of Thailand (SRT), Worawut Mala, told Reuters.

The SRT expects to finalize a consulting agreement for the second phase by the end of this month, the Ministry of Transport said in a statement.

The trains will run at speeds up to 250 kph (155 mph), with ticket prices ranging between 107 baht to 534 baht ($3.50 to $17.45), Traisuree said.

Delayed	NEW DELHI: India’s bid to upgrade its infrastructure is confronted by a new risk factor — contract cancellation or asking for reviews of big projects following change in state governments. This can be a significant risk for investors, market watchers said.The latest example of a project risk following a regime change is from Maharashtra and the target is the ambitious Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project. This follows contract cancellations for building a city in Amravati and renewable power projects in Andhra Pradesh Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray, who heads a three-party alliance formed after polls to keep BJP out of power, has said he will review India’s bullet train corridor, a project started by the previous BJP government in 2014. He has also stayed the work on the Metro car shed project at Aarey Colony, a project that drew both green activists and court intervention.In most cases, costs incurred by a contractor during the preconstruction activity is unaccounted for and turned into a loss if the project does not fructify.“Apart from cost overruns and delays, such uncertainty causes an existential dilemma as to whether the project will come to life,” Vinayak Chatterjee, chairman at Feedback Infra said.In case of public-private partnership (PPP) projects it directly hits the finances of contractors while in case of projects like the high-speed rail corridor which is being jointly funded by the Japanese government, proposed move may dent India’s bilateral relations that were built with considerable effort, say experts.“Projects like the bullet train are funded by multilateral Japanese agencies and are mostly funded externally. So in that sense the risk for local lenders is less. But there are allied activities tied with these projects which may be impacted in case of review and this could impact future prospects of economic growth. But it is too early to say how this government will review these projects,” said a senior public sector bank official.Pointing out that a stable policy environment is a prerequisite for drawing investors, Hindustan Construction Company chairman Ajit Gulabchand said, “You are creating this instability in regulation, you are removing the predictability. This is not conducive for any investments. If you want to bring it (foreign funds for big infrastructure projects) in, you have to create this environment.”“Re-thinking, and cancellation in some cases lead to loss in financial capital, social capital in terms of services to citizens, political capital and economic, in terms of jobs and construction activity that the project would have otherwise created,” Chatterjee said.Another example of investments being jeopardised due to political differences is that of YS Jaganmohan Reddy-led Andhra Pradesh government recently renegotiating power purchase agreements (PPAs) signed during the regime of Chandrababu Naidu of the Telugu Desam Party.Besides re-negotiating power purchase agreements (PPAs) with renewable energy developers, the Andhra government led by Reddy also stopped procuring electric vehicles for government fleets from Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL).“New governments not respecting their predecessor’s contracts is the single-biggest challenge that this country is facing. It is very childish to be honest,” a senior government official said, commenting on the development.“There are two kinds of foreign investors who are currently suffering from zigzag approach in legislative changes in infrastructure space. One are investors and other are EPC players who are involved in such projects,” said Ranjit Prakash, chief executive partner, Archeus Law.In July, the World Bank and Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) pulled out of the Amravati Capital City project in Andhra Pradesh after the Reddy government decided to review it.“The change in the government increases financing risk because a review could delay the project and lead to cost overuns,” said senior private bank executive. Some large projects are funded by foreign agencies, but there is also a local component.Lenders will not disburse the amounts sanctioned if there are delays, the executive said. “Also when foreign companies are involved there are force majeure clauses involved in the contract which allows these firms to review their funding in extraordinary events. All these things will have to be taken into account,” said a senior private sector bank executive.(With inputs from Nehal Chaliawala, Maulik Vyas and Joel Rebello)	https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/firing-a-bullet-at-indias-infra-dream/articleshow/72340940.cms
Delayed	"The entire process of land acquisition for this project was started in August.

Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train: India’s first bullet train project has missed its land acquisition deadline! Recently, the Consul General of Japan in Mumbai Ryoji Noda was quoted in an IE report saying that the deadline of December 2018 has been missed and he does not know if this would delay the scheduled completion of the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project by 2022. The Japanese side cannot do anything about the delay, so they are waiting for the state governments of Gujarat and Maharashtra to procure the land, he said. Earlier this year, it was reported that the process of land acquisition in Gujarat would take another 7-8 months and stretch beyond the month of June 2019, after the upcoming Lok Sabha elections.

Along with the National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited (NHSRCL), which is executing the bullet train project in India, the state governments will acquire 612 hectare in Gujarat, 246 hectare in Maharashtra and 7.5 hectare in Dadra and Nagar Haveli. For the development of the project, as many as 5,404 people will have to give up their land in Gujarat, with the city of Ahmedabad topping the list with 1,196 people, the report said.

While speaking about the project during Question Hour in the Gujarat Assembly, Deputy Chief minister Nitin Patel on February 10 said that a total of 197 villages of Gujarat’s 32 talukas will be acquired. Till now, a total of 110 plots, measuring 160 hectare, have been acquired from farmers with their consent. An amount of Rs 620 crore has been disbursed for this as compensation, he said.

The entire process of land acquisition for this project was started in August. As compensation to farmers, the state government said that it will pay 25 per cent more than the award to those farmers who have consented to give up their land. Also, the government will pay 80 per cent of the awarded amount, up front, the report stated.

With the commencement of the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train, it is being expected that the journey between the two cities would take only around 2 hours, which currently takes 7 hours approximately."	https://www.financialexpress.com/infrastructure/railways/indias-first-mumbai-ahmedabad-bullet-train-set-to-miss-deadline-land-acquisition-delays-plague-project/1515985/
Delayed	"PALGHAR, India/TOKYO (Reuters) - India is set to miss a December deadline to acquire land for a Japan-backed $17 billion bullet train project following protests by fruit growers, government officials said, likely delaying one of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s most ambitious projects.

Modi’s office is now monitoring the project week-to-week, as Indian officials seek to reassure Tokyo that the hurdles can be overcome through intense negotiations with sapota and mango growers in the western state of Maharashtra.

Protests, backed by local politicians, have flared up in recent months against attempts to secure sections of a 108-km (67-mile) stretch, which is around one-fifth of the entire bullet train corridor connecting Mumbai with Ahmedabad, the largest commercial city in Modi’s home state of Gujarat.

“I’ve worked hard for three decades to develop this plantation, and they are asking me to hand over this land,” sapota farmer Dashrat Purav, 62, said as he showed his orchard in the town of Palghar, a three-hour-drive north of Mumbai.

“I haven’t worked hard to surrender land for the project. I did that for my children.”

Purav said he would sell his land only if at least one of his two unemployed sons was promised a government job.

Protests against land acquisitions are common in India, where tens of millions of farmers till small holdings. A planned $44 billion refinery to be run by a consortium including Saudi Aramco, the world’s biggest oil producer, is also struggling to secure land in Maharashtra.

“Land acquisition for any project is complex in India,” said Dhananjay Kumar, spokesman for the National High Speed Rail Corp Ltd (NHSRCL) that is overseeing the project. “Here also we are facing difficulty because of so much resistance.”

Failure to procure the bullet train land by the deadline would delay disbursal of soft-loans by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), a government development body, which is reviewing the project next month, said two senior officials with the state-run Indian Railways, declining to be named.

A JICA spokeswoman said that India must create relocation plans for local residents and make them public in order to enter into a loan agreement covering the main part of the bullet train project.

“It is possible that it takes time to sign a contract as India takes proper and careful measures in line with JICA’s guidelines for environmental and social considerations,” she said.

NHSRCL’s Kumar, said in a statement on late Tuesday that the sanction of the loan by JICA was not linked to the land acquisition.

To assuage Japan’s concerns, Indian officials have sought a meeting this month with transport ministry officials in Tokyo, one of the Indian officials said. India wants the project’s completion target to be advanced by a year to 2022, the 75th year of India’s independence.

NHSRCL said in its statement that no such meeting has been requested by India.

A Japanese transport ministry official who deals with the bullet train project said that Indian officials had told them that “they can manage” the land acquisition.

“We will continue to work together with the Indian government to bring this project forward with an aim to start operation in 2023,” the official said.

“NOT INSURMOUNTABLE”

Japan is majority-funding the train project through a 50-year loan. Japanese companies such as Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal Corp (5401.T), JFE Holdings (5411.T), Kawasaki Heavy Industries (7012.T), Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (7011.T), Toshiba Corp (6502.T) and Hitachi (6501.T) are likely to supply at least 70 percent of the core components of the rail line, sources told Reuters in January.

NHSRCL, a joint venture between the Ministry of Railways and states involved in the project, said at the time that procurement from Japan would be only 18 percent of the total project cost.

Modi has called the project crucial for his pet “Make in India” campaign aimed at lifting the share of manufacturing in India’s $2 trillion economy. The government also hopes to generate hundreds of jobs through the train project, and hence is pushing hard to finish it on time.

To sweeten the terms for people opposed to selling their land, Indian Railways has put its weight behind NHSRCL, pledging funds from its own welfare scheme to build schools and community halls, one of the officials said. NHSRCL said it would be using its own funds for any such welfare scheme.

Ashwani Lohani, chairman of the Indian Railway Board, said the issues with farmers were not insurmountable.

The government has offered to buy land at a 25 percent premium to the market value, the two government officials said. Farmers are also being offered resettlement dues of 500,000 rupees ($7,409) or 50 percent of the land value, whichever is higher.

However, local political opposition in Palghar, ahead of a general election next year, has fanned the protests. Opponents say the bullet train is wasteful and the money would be better used upgrading the country’s rickety rail infrastructure. Farmers have threatened a hunger strike.

Last week, farmers and local activists disrupted a public hearing conducted by NHSRCL, its second attempt to hold such an event in less than a month. The first one last month was also cut short by protests.

“In coming weeks we will intensify the protests,” said Nilam Gorhe, a spokesman for Shiv Sena, a Maharashtra regional party that has an on-off relationship with Modi’s ruling party."	https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-india-train/india-set-to-miss-key-target-for-japan-backed-bullet-train-project-sources-idUSKBN1J72QG

The delays will push the project’s anticipated completion date from late 2022 to the end of 2023, the world’s leading offshore wind developer said.

“As the federal permitting timeline evolves, Ørsted is now receiving its federal Notice of Intent for the Skipjack Wind Farm later than originally anticipated,” Ørsted said.

”As a result, Ørsted has determined that moving Skipjack Wind Farm’s anticipated completion date from late 2022 to the new target of the end of 2023 puts us in the strongest position possible to deliver a successful project. Ørsted remains firmly committed to working with our federal partners to complete Skipjack and provide clean, reliable offshore wind energy to 35,000 homes in the Delmarva region.”

Located 17-26 miles off the coast of the Delmarva Peninsula, the Skipjack Wind Farm will feature GE Haliade-X 12 MW wind turbines, subject to final agreed and signed contract, and all required project approvals.

Once commissioned, the wind turbines will provide enough electricity to meet the demand of nearly 35,000 average US households.

The project will create around 1,400 jobs in Maryland, Ørsted said. This includes 913 jobs, measured in full-time equivalents, during the development/construction phase, and 484 jobs during the operating period.

Ørsted will develop the project at Maryland’s first offshore wind energy staging center at Tradepoint Atlantic, Baltimore County.

The wind farm will connect to the PJM grid in Delaware via a newly constructed interconnection facility in Fenwick Island State Park."	https://www.offshorewind.biz/2020/04/23/orsteds-skipjack-delayed-due-to-permitting-issues/

NAKHON RATCHASIMA, Thailand (Reuters) - Construction of a long-awaited Thai-Chinese railway line that will link Thailand, Laos and China officially began on Thursday with a ground-breaking ceremony in the northeastern Thai province of Nakhon Ratchasima.

The first phase of the project, a 250-km (155 mile) high-speed rail line linking Bangkok to Nakhon Ratchasima, is expected to be operational in 2021.

The full line is expected to stretch 873 km (542 miles), linking Thailand and Laos at the northeastern Thai city of Nong Khai.

It is part of Beijing’s ambitious Belt and Road infrastructure drive, which aims to build a modern-day “Silk Road” connecting China to economies in Southeast and Central Asia by land and the Middle East and Europe by sea.

But the Thailand project, which began in 2014 with formal talks, has been beset by delays, including disagreements over the design and funding as well as technical assistance.

Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha on Thursday presided over a ceremony to begin construction of the first, 3.5-km section of the railway.

“Thailand is developing in every aspect to become the centre of connectivity ... and this route is to connect to Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam to China, India and further to other countries,” Prayuth said in a speech.

Completion of the first section is expected to take six months, according to the transport ministry.

In September, Thailand signed two contracts worth $157 million with Chinese state enterprises covering the engineering design of the project and the hiring of Chinese technical advisers."	https://www.reuters.com/article/us-thailand-china-railway/after-delays-ground-broken-for-thailand-china-railway-project-idUSKBN1EF1E6

AGARTALA: The much awaited Agartala-Akhaura international railway project to connect Bangladesh railway track with North-East Frontier Railways is likely to be delayed by nine months, according to an assessment by IRCON International Ltd, the nodal organisation for the project.

The railway link connects Gangasagar in Bangladesh to Nischintapur in India (10.6 km) and from Nischitapur to Agartala railway station (5.46 Kms).

The project was scheduled to be completed in December 2020 and its status report, which was made available here on Friday, said the date is no likely to be September 2021.

The report quoting Yogesh Kumar Mishra, the director of IRCON International Ltd which is one of the executing agencies of the project, said the construction work from Gangasagar to Nischintapur may be completed by September 2020. But the work from Ninschintapur to Agartala Railway situation is likely to be completed by September 2021.

IRCON International joint general manager H K Singh said the cause of delay on the Indian side is due to the soil condition and the construction of a 3.1 km long viaduct.

The condition of the soil is not very favourable for laying the track near Nischintapur on the Indian side. It(the soil) is marshy and soft, so we are doing many kinds of treatments. We have to build a viaduct, which is also difficult. So the project will be delayed , Singh said.

The DoNER ministry is bearing the cost of laying the railway track from Agartala to Nischintapur and the Ministry of External Affairs from the border to Gangasagar in Brahmanberia district of Bangladesh.

The cost for laying the railway tracks between Agartala to Nischintapur is Rs 580 crore and the executing agency is IRCON International Ltd. Rs 217.63 crore has been released for it and Rs 140.73 crore has been spent on it as on 31st July 2019.

AGARTALA: The 15-km Agartala-Akhaura railway line connecting India and Bangladesh may miss its September 20 deadline.

The project - connecting Badharghat to Nishchintapur in India and onwards to Gangasagar in Bangladesh - was conceptualized in 2010 and the MoU was signed by India and Bangladesh in 2013. Once complete, the railway line will reduce travel time between Agartala and Kolkata from 31 hours to 10 hours, cutting the distance short from 1,600 km to 550 km. It will also allow goods to be transported from the Chittagong port to Agartala faster.

""Work on both stretches has been very slow. The target was to complete laying the railway lines by September next year, but it will be delayed,"" an Indian Railway Construction Company Limited (IRCON) official said.

Chief minister Biplab Deb reviewed the work on Tuesday with a four-member team, headed by IRCON director (construction) Jogesh Mishra. Later, meeting officials from IRCON and Texmaco Rail and Engineering Limited, Deb asked them to speed up the work to meet the deadline, adding that he would keep reviewing the progress.

To facilitate better connectivity between India and Bangladesh, Deb said there is a plan to launch a bus service from the Agartala airport to Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh via the bridge over the Feni river , also under construction. The journey will take about three to four hours now.

Delayed	"Ørsted’s decision to divest from its liquefied natural gas business in December came as no surprise to observers tracking the company's progress in offshore wind. The Danish developer has so much offshore wind business in motion that experts predict it will lead the market for at least half a decade.

Although Ørsted faces competition from companies such as RWE, Iberdrola, Vattenfall and Shell, “Looking five years ahead, I don’t think other developers can beat them for the ‘first’ title,” said Feng Zhao, strategy director at the Global Wind Energy Council, an industry group based in Brussels.

Ørsted, which started out as a state-owned oil and gas company called Dansk Olie og Naturgas, or Dong, had 9.9 gigawatts of offshore wind installed or past a final investment decision, according to a 2019 company report issued at the end of January.

Ørsted expects to have around 15 gigawatts of capacity commissioned by 2025. That’s more than Europe’s six next-largest offshore wind developers combined, based on a Goldman Sachs forecast published in The Economist in August.

The Danish offshore wind powerhouse is gunning for 30 gigawatts by 2030. “If they can materialize their 2030 target, they can hold the throne for sure,” the Global Wind Energy Council's Zhao said in an interview.

At the moment, the only offshore wind developer that even comes close to Ørsted is Germany’s RWE Renewables, which reported 2.5 gigawatts of turbine capacity in the water as of the end of August 2019.

But even though RWE is gearing up for growth, with a development pipeline of more than 5 gigawatts of offshore wind, the sheer scale of Ørsted’s build-out means the German company will likely lose ground to the market leader over the coming years.

Emerging market risk

Ørsted’s growth prospects come with two significant caveats. The first is that much of the company’s expansion in the next half-decade is expected to come from markets that are still emerging and therefore might be subject to delays and regulatory risks.

In the U.S., for example, Ørsted is hoping to develop more than 2.9 gigawatts of capacity in two East Coast clusters that will include the South Fork, Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind projects in the Northeast and Skipjack and Ocean Wind in the mid-Atlantic.

Ørsted expects to commission the projects between 2022 and 2024. But getting offshore wind plants built in the U.S. has so far proven to be tricky.

Progress at the first large-scale project in the country, Vineyard Wind, unexpectedly stalled in August after the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management postponed approving a final environmental impact statement.

It's also notable that Ørsted has so far refused to consider a move into floating wind platforms. These could ultimately offer access to much larger markets than are currently accessible with fixed-bottom turbines of the kind that Ørsted specializes in installing.

Neither of these issues appears to pose much of a threat to Ørsted’s dominance in offshore wind, however. As it stands, most developers are too exposed to the vagaries of emerging markets, so slow adoption in regions such as North America or Asia won’t affect Ørsted alone.

And as for floating offshore wind, there is widespread speculation that Ørsted is simply waiting for the right moment to make its move. “We don’t currently have plans to actively enter floating wind,"" confirmed Tom Lehn-Christiansen, head of media relations at Ørsted Offshore, in December.

But ""we always monitor new technologies and incorporate them in our wind farms,"" Lehn-Christiansen added. ""More than anyone, we’re aware of how fast technologies can mature, and the costs come down, so we’re following the development of floating foundation technologies closely.”

Erik Rijkers, director of market development and strategy at the specialist consultancy Quest Floating Wind Energy, said: “I am convinced they will include floating in their portfolio once the projects get too big and the shallow water space runs out.”

The rise of Equinor

In the long term, said Zhao, perhaps the only company that could give Ørsted a run for its money is Equinor, another Nordic oil and gas firm that is pivoting toward offshore wind.

Equinor was the biggest winner in the U.K.’s third offshore wind round, picking up 3.6 gigawatts of capacity, and has a 1.5-gigawatt pipeline in Poland, Zhao said. It also has a presence in the key offshore wind growth markets of U.S., Japan, South Korea and China (via a memorandum of understanding with the State Power Investment Corporation).

There's also the fact that Equinor is the world leader in floating wind.

Ørsted isn’t resting on its laurels, though. In January it established a new operating model for its offshore business, focusing efforts on a regional basis targeting the U.K., continental Europe, North America and Asia-Pacific.

It “creates a more scalable organization for Ørsted’s international expansion, which combines market proximity with global scale and efficiency,” said the company in a press release.

Delayed	"THE National Electrification Administration (NEA) said its off-grid solar project to power far-flung communities faces delay as the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic disrupts trade.

In a statement on Wednesday, the agency tasked to power rural communities said the solar photovoltaic (PV) mainstreaming project saw a delay in the delivery of solar panels coming from China.

“The competitive bidding process and the awarding of contracts to the successful bidders have already been completed. We are just awaiting delivery of solar panels, which will be coming from China,” said Ernesto O. Silvano, Jr., acting manager of NEA’s total electrification and renewable energy development department.

The solar project under NEA’s expanded household electrification program seeks to cover around 5,000 households that are deemed “unviable” for grid connection in the next five years.

The agency allotted P153 million for its implementation.

Households that will benefit from the project are those in the coverage areas of five electric cooperatives: Busuanga Island Electric Cooperative, Inc.; Camarines Sur IV Electric Cooperative, Inc.; Iloilo III Electric Cooperative, Inc.; Cotabato Electric Cooperative, Inc.; and Zamboanga del Norte Electric Cooperative, Inc.

These power cooperatives are set to receive 5,039 solar home system units, which provide cost-effective means to supply electricity to communities not connected to power grids.

The project is part of NEA’s target this year to power 775 sitios or rural villages, as well as 38 resettlement sites by local government units.

As of 2018, there are around 19,740 unpowered sitios across the country, 1,702 of which were classified as off-grid.

This year, the government allotted P1.53 billion for the agency’s electrification projects, which include its sitio electrification program.

Providing electricity to a sitio, NEA noted, costs at least P1.5 million on average. — Adam J. Ang

Delayed	"India is likely to see over 3GW of solar and wind projects delayed due to the country’s coronavirus lockdown, according to analyst Wood Mackenzie.

The analyst has downgraded the year’s solar PV outlook by 24.8% as the industry is dependent on importing modules from China. In total it expects to see solar PV build out reduced by 2.9GW to 8.9GW.

The analyst also says supply and labour disruptions from the current lockdown could delay 400 megawatts (MW) of this year’s scheduled 3GW wind build into 2021, equating to a downgrade of 11% for 2020.

Overall Wood Mackenzie sees a 21.6% downgrade to this year’s build out.

Wood Mackenzie principal analyst Robert Liew said: “The timing of the lockdown is unfortunate as Q1 is typically one of the busiest periods for wind project installations.

""The lockdown will delay some projects until summer, and if the lockdown is extended past April, wind farm construction could be further delayed into the monsoon season, where wind installations are typically at their lowest.”

Similar to the wind sector, India’s solar PV installations are expected to be hit hard as the industry is heavily dependent on Chinese PV module imports – amounting to 80% of total volume - which have been disrupted due to the coronavirus.

Senior analyst Rishab Shrestha said: “Current supply and labour disruptions will have an outsized negative impact on 2020 installations. Q1 is expected to be strongly impacted with a potential 60% year-on-year quarterly downgrade, or 1.2 GW, down from about 3 GW in Q1 2019.

“We remain cautious on the outlook for the second half of the year as supply and logistics bottlenecks linger. Consequently, our full year downgrade stands at 2.9 GW, a 24.8% reduction resulting in a revised 2020 outlook of 8.9 GW of solar PV installations.”

Wood Mackenzies says the Indian states with the highest coronavirus infection rates also correspond with the areas that are favourable to wind and solar development.

The state of Gujarat delivered 58% or 1.4 GW of new added wind capacity in India in 2019, and unfortunately, stands as one of the top ten worst hit states in terms of coronavirus infections according to the analyst.

On the solar front, the states of Karnataka (2 GW), Tamil Nadu (1.6 GW) and Rajasthan (1.7 GW) were the top three states accounting for 55% of solar PV installations in 2019, and are all in the top ten worst hit states.

Liew and Shrestha added that if the virus situation continues to escalate and the lockdown is extended, there will be severe financial impact on utility companies. This will have an impact on solar PV and wind installation developers’ cash flows."	https://renews.biz/59522/covid-19-delays-expected-to-indian-build-out/
Delayed	"Outstanding permitting for the delayed 800MW Vineyard project off Massachusetts may not be resolved until December, when the US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) is expected to issue a final decision.

A much-awaited supplement to the draft environmental impact statement (EIS) is currently expected on 12 June.

The Vineyard phase 1 of Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners and Avangrid’s ""pathfinder"" project will miss its original commissioning date of 2022. The deadline for a conditional order for MHI Vestas V164-9.5MW turbines expired in early March.

The National Marine Fisheries Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, had refused to endorse BOEM’s draft EIS for Vineyard, complaining that fishing concerns were not addressed adequately. This helped trigger the government’s ongoing analysis of offshore wind’s cumulative impacts in the region.

Studying cumulative impacts is extremely complicated, said Bonnie Ram, a senior researcher at the Centre for Research in Wind at the University of Delaware. BOEM is not a large agency and is learning as it proceeds, she noted.

""I think it’s fair to say that the US federal government was not expecting the industry to ramp up in the way it did, and that some permitting timelines probably suffered as a result,"" added Rachel Shifman, a wind analyst at BloombergNEF.

""On the other hand, the Trump administration did just increase BOEM’s budget, which should help alleviate some permitting pinch points.""

Unresolved issues

Transit lanes of 4 nautical miles (7.4km) wide and up to 70nm (130km) long for a wind-development area off Massachusetts and Rhode Island, proposed by a major fishing group, the Responsible Offshore Development Alliance (Roda), area major sticking point.

The project developers that would be impacted — Vineyard Wind, Mayflower Wind, Ørsted/Eversource and Equinor — had already proposed a compromise that turbines be spaced 1 nautical mile (1.9km) apart without the transit lanes.

In public comments on the USCG port-access study, Meghan Lapp, fisheries liaison for frozen fish supplier Seafreeze, a subsidiary of Spain-based conglomerate Grupo Profand, called for the lanes.

However, the USCG draft study said that no additional vessel routing measures would be needed if turbines were installed in a standard, uniform grid pattern with standard spacing and at least three lines of orientation.

The agency did not comment on the developers’ 1 x1 nm proposal.

Lapp also called for an assurance of maritime safety that she said would be compromised by radar interference from wind turbines.

Lapp cited a study overseen by the USCG on radar impacts of the Cape Wind project, the ill-fated 486MW wind farm off Massachusetts that should have been America’s first commercial offshore project but was litigated to death until developer Energy Management pulled the plug in 2017.

But the USCG’s draft study said it was not aware of an ""authoritative"" scientific study that confirms or refutes the concern that turbines will degrade marine radar.

According to Ørsted and Eversource, joint owners of three BOEM leases in the New England wind energy area, the proposed transit lanes would result in the loss of more than 50 wind turbines from their South Fork, Revolution, and Sunrise Wind projects.

""This equates to nearly a 25% loss in total wind-turbine locations needed to support our PPAs [power purchase agreements],"" they said.

The transit lanes ""may render the billions of dollars of investment economically unfeasible"", the partners warned.

Ørsted, the global sector leader, is a member of a joint task force with Roda, along with six other wind developers — EDF Renewables, Equinor, Mayflower, Vineyard, Avangrid and EnBW. Public comments closed on 16 March.

The other main sticking point is access to fishing grounds within proposed wind arrays, Annie Hawkins, Roda’s executive director, pointed out in an interview with Windpower Monthly.

While Roda has not specifically endorsed the developers’ uniform layout with 1-nautical-mile spacing, it has not objected either.

Pressure to meet targets

Hawkins called current regulations for offshore wind woefully inadequate with regard to commercial fishing.

She cites the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, which calls for offshore-wind development to be ""carried out in a manner that provides for consideration of any other use of the sea or seabed, including use for a fishery, sea lane, a potential deep-water port, or navigation.""

She described BOEM’s guidelines as too vague and incomprehensive.

States set offshore-wind goals that create what she described as a ""feedback loop"" of developers rushing in to meet these targets without taking enough time to survey an area for turbines and cables or liaise with fishermen.

""If they did include fisheries mitigation in a bid, their price would almost certainly come in higher than their competitors and they would lose the contract, since bids are weighed almost entirely on price per unit of energy,"" she said.

The wind industry vehemently disputes that there is not enough consultation and planning.

Vineyard Wind recalls that it hired the first designated fisheries liaison for US offshore wind in 2010, and that it held more than 100 meetings with fisheries representatives in 2017 and 2018 alone.

Need for regional approach

One problem is that individual states are setting aggressive goals for offshore-wind development, but neither fish nor fishing vessels stick to state lines, as Ram pointed out.

""A regional approach is desperately needed,"" she said, citing the vast pressures on commercial fishing, from climate change to pollution and plastic waste.

""We need to think bigger, we need to think regionally, and we need to think of climate impacts.""

Asked if offshore oil and gas has faced less scrutiny than offshore wind, she said there were fewer regulations when offshore fossil fuels got off the ground 50 years ago.

In Europe, there have been isolated disputes over co-existence, such as protests by fishermen in Amsterdam. The Netherlands and Belgium are working on a regulatory framework to allow transit and co-use in offshore wind farms, without bottom trawling, according to WindEurope.

In Germany, fishing is not the most important competing use due to the sector’s declining economic importance as a result of overfishing in the North Sea, according to Heike Winkler, managing director of German offshore-wind industry group WAB.

The UK, which has more of a fishing industry than Germany, allows fishing within arrays, excluding bottom trawling.

However, fishermen have become fearful of their gear becoming entrapped by seabed obstacles such as cables, and wary of vessel breakdown with the consequent risk of turbine collision, said WindEurope."	https://www.windpowermonthly.com/article/1678225/fishing-offshore-industries-no-closer-finding-solutions

For the PV industry, accustomed as it is to growth, it is near impossible to predict what impact the shock delivered by Covid-19 and the shutdowns employed to limit its spread will have. On March 13, BloombergNEF announced that it was downwardly revising its forecast for new installed capacity from its initial figures of between 121-152 GW to 108-143 GW. The former forecast had only been made in February.

Notably, the pessimistic end of the revised forecast represents an annual decline in solar installations – the first of its kind, at least in this century.

“Our forecast encompasses both a rise and fall of the solar market [year on year],” says Jenny Chase, the head of BloombergNEF’s Solar Insight team. “Which is hedging our bets a bit, but we cut both of our forecasts.” Chase says that while it’s difficult “to know exactly” what the impact of Covid-19 will be, the large-scale segment will likely see some committed projects pushed back to 2021.

Developers and suppliers, Chase reports, are claiming Covid-19 represents a “Force Majeure event” – meaning that delivery and competition deadlines are forgiven. “I think this is quite healthy,” says Chase, although it will impact installation rates for 2020. She notes that one developer in the United States invoked Force Majeure on the basis of being unable to feed its workers – due to all local restaurants being closed.

The commercial rooftop PV segment may be largely unaffected this year, the BloombergNEF analyst reports. But C&I companies may bear the full brunt of the viral downturn in 2021.

“It is probably not that bad, because most of the commercial rooftop systems were already lined up for this,” says Chase. “In 2021 it will be worse hit, because the pipeline will suffer … doing commercial businesses takes many people to sign off on a project, meaning that the pipeline will dry up.”

On the upside, Chase notes that installing solar requires little physical contact, so is generally a “low risk” workplace activity in the Covid-19-impacted workplace. As economies in key solar markets like the United States and Europe begin to reopen for business, it is likely that PV installations could resume. “It strikes me that it [PV] could be one of the things to be eased up at an early stage,” says Chase.

Stimulus support

There does exist the chance that various stimulus measures introduced by national or even regional governments could be directed the way of solar. Already, there is talk an extension to the U.S. Investment Tax Credit could be bundled into a raft of stimulus measures. In Australia, an expansion of immediate tax writedowns for businesses on capital investment, including rooftop PV and battery storage, appears to be delivering a positive signal. And government spending programs potentially funding the installation of rooftop solar on schools and other public buildings could provide a boost in many solar markets.

On the residential side, currently there are mixed reports coming from the installers. Household budgets will undoubtedly be stressed, and there are reports of cancellations coming from retailers. However, very low interest rates could incentivize “zero-up-front” solar loans – delivering the dual payoff of keeping cash in the pockets of the homeowner, and reducing their home office costs, in the form of electricity bills.

For the “preppers” – those looking to secure sufficient supplies of essentials – a solar+storage system could deliver peace of mind. Indeed, electricity may be the new toilet paper – despite there being few signals that electricity supplies are set to be disrupted.

China, as always a central player in the global solar industry, presents an example of hope. Increasingly, there are signs that a degree of normality is returning – some three months after the more drastic containment measures were put in place. Projects are delayed, but signs are that activity on the supply side is returning to normal.

As it will for the wider economy, Covid-19 will likely cause businesses to reflect inwardly on what their core mission is and jobs will undoubtedly be lost, along with the opportunity for ongoing market expansion in the short term. Fortuitously for solar businesses, instability and sudden shocks are the norm in this young sector. As one veteran put it: “This isn’t my first ride on the solarcoaster.”

PV steps up to the plate Some solar and battery storage manufacturers are going beyond protecting their own businesses and are making contributions to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic head on. Chinese manufacturer BYD announced in early March that it had established a factory to produce 5 million face masks and 300,000 bottles of disinfectant per day. Tesla’s Elon Musk, despite having previously sent some mixed signals about the severity of the global pandemic, acquired 1,255 ventilators from China, shipped them to California and has teams working with officials on their installation.

U.S. residential faces trouble over the next few quarters The U.S. coronavirus emergency stimulus package could contain an extension of tax deadlines for solar, but as of the time of press deadline, the U.S. congress and the Trump administration had not reached agreement on the details of the $2 trillion bill. Stocks bounced higher in anticipation of the deal being signed. The Democrats have little leverage, but the members of these deliberative bodies must vote by unanimous consent if they are not physically in the nation’s capital – and they are not. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) is warning that the impact from the coronavirus could cut the solar industry’s headcount in half. SEIA is trying to push Congress to make the solar federal tax credit payable directly to customers. Popular content Solar installers in the U.S. are already feeling the pain of the measures taken to slow the virus. “The impact of Covid-19 on our business is becoming increasingly severe. Over the past month we’ve gone from sanitizers and hand wipes (three weeks ago), to social distancing with only one person per vehicle (last week), to a partial shutdown as customers cancel or postpone their projects. I expect this situation will get even worse over the next month,” noted Barry Cinnamon of Cinnamon Energy Systems. He added, “Customers are canceling because they are worried about their financial portfolios, and also want to maintain social distancing. From a portfolio standpoint, we remind customers that solar is just about the best investment they can make in these uncertain times.” Vendors close to the installer market are being affected. The HR lead at Shoals Technologies Group noted that the solar hardware provider plans “to fully compensate ALL of our employees in the event we need to shut down operations due to Covid-19. This plan will positively impact over 600 people who are paid an hourly wage.” Roth Capital Partners reports that “some U.S. installers are now seeing a 30% cancellation or postponement of bookings, and the sales funnel is drying up.” Despite the momentum in U.S. residential solar, Roth speculates that U.S. residential demand “could be meaningfully impacted to the downside.” Roth expects Q2 to be very weak, ”though some believe we could see a strong recovery in Q3,” as well as “a potential oversupply” as production ramps-up and global demand potentially slows. Cinnamon notes, “Nevertheless, I expect almost all businesses to prepare for a few months of hibernation – no one really knows how this situation will evolve. I also hope that the federal government will pass legislation that will support both hourly and salary workers who are subject to the inevitable work slowdowns.” Eric Wesoff Weak dollar adds insult to injury Down Under Before the Covid-19 outbreak changed the way we interact and do business, Australia’s rooftop PV segment was in robust health and looked set to achieve a world-beating 3 GW in 2020. While installation numbers in January and February were 30% up on the same months last year, mixed reports are now coming from different corners of the market. Wholesalers have been reassuring customers about their access to stock, but for now, supply appears to remain somewhat limited. Industry players have been talking about two to eight-week delays in supply. Yet, the impact of the outbreak seems to be rather individual – some companies have reported an unprecedented surge in sales and inquiries, while some are saying the phones have stopped ringing. Installations are still going ahead. Some companies have seen requests for projects to be done before a full lockdown occurs or before price increases hit them. The Covid-19 outbreak coincides with the slide of the Australian dollar, which plunged mid-March to its lowest level since 2002, hailing increases in module and inverter prices for the Australian consumer. On the positive side, the Government has announced that businesses investments up to $150,000 can be instantly written off on tax. This could be a useful lever to drive uptake of C&I rooftop PV in the months to come. Marija Maisch"	https://www.pv-magazine.com/2020/04/11/the-weekend-read-pv-in-the-pandemic/

Sundance Resources' 40 million mt/year iron ore project in Congo Brazzaville and Cameroon looks set to resurface following years of adjustment, with the expected signing later this month of a mining accord by the Cameroon government, a project investor said.

Like another major African iron ore project, Simandou Blocks 1&2, the $6 billion Sundance project is to be be developed mainly with Chinese financial backers who will provide infrastructure, and all the ore was expected to go to China.

Aime Emmanuel Yoka, managing partner of Singapore-based Marys Capital Investments, one of the partners in the project, told S&P Global Platts in an interview the Cameroon government was set to renew its Mbalam Convention by the end of this year.

That will allow Sundance's various foreign partners to operate in Cameroon and get necessary permits.

On the Congo Brazzaville side, everything was in place, Yoka said. A new mining convention was ratified in 2016 and the country's parliament is fully open to foreign investment.

Sundance, a direct shipping iron ore (DSO) project with mines 40 km apart in Congo Brazzaville and Cameroon, has suffered disruptions and uncertainty following a helicopter crash in which the entire board of the original project died in 2010.

Feasibility studies were nonetheless completed in 2012. The project was further held up by a subsequent fall in commodity prices and delays in Congo and Cameroon establishing a mining convention.

Iron ore's price surge in 2019 signaled a distinct market for high-grade ore which can help reduce emissions in the steelmaking process, improving prospects for Sundance's high-grade project.

Following the expected renewal of the Mbalam Convention, the project will still need approval from both Australian and Chinese authorities.

According to an agreement signed on July 5, Sundance's majority stakeholder partner will be AustSino, a company registered on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). Funds and resource companies currently with holdings in Sundance are Marys Capital Investments, D&E Shaw, Seringan, Noble Resources, Blackstone and Wajin, while strategic partners include the China Railway Construction Company CRCC, Shenzhen Yantian Port, steelmaker Baowu and stainless steel producer Tsingshan.

The strategic partners were expected to put up 30% equity for the project, with 70% being put up by their banks as debt, involving agreements and transactions that need to be finalized post June 2020, according to Yoka.

""I am 70% sure this will go ahead,"" Yoka said.

Infrastructure hurdle

Sundance's partners have already invested $500 million in exploration and feasibility studies and the mine installations are partly built.

The big hurdle is infrastructure. A $3.4 billion, 540 km railway from Cameroon, with a 40 km branch line to the mine site in Congo Brazzaville, is required for efficient shipping to an existing port at Kribi in Cameroon, where another $800 million will be required to construct a Sundance terminal.

The railway and port terminal were expected to take three years to build, meaning first production from the mine was foreseen in 2024. Energy supplies are also needed.

Yoka envisaged that once infrastructure was in place, Sundance could produce 15 million mt DSO of 62% Fe quality in its first year of operation, rising to its full 40 million mt/year in the second year.

The project is greenfield and open pit, with enough DSO reserves (517 million mt) for 13 years and then a further 6 billion mt of itabirite reserves that could give the mine a total 25 years mine life.

The idea is to mine at both the Cameroon and Congo Brazzaville sites and blend the two ores before shipping to guarantee payback, Yoka said.

Resource nationalism may, however, pose risks to the project, especially as the Chinese operators may be expected to wish to bring in some of the labor for the project, which may clash with local labor laws.

The project was expected to create some 5,000 direct jobs, represent 15% of Congo Brazzaville's GDP for the years of its operation and 10% of Cameroon's.

""The Chinese investors know that the local population represents a significant risk to the project,"" Yoka said.

""It will be a tough battle to get the percentage of local and percentage of Chinese labor sorted out. But our job is to ensure that all parties, investors and populations alike benefit from the project.""

Delayed	"From pv magazine Australia

Movements in the foreign-exchange market triggered by the Covid-19 outbreak will affect all segments of the renewables market. According to Norwegian consultancy Rystad Energy, solar and wind projects will be particularly affected, as companies choose to pause development by contracting key components, which are typically procured in US dollars.

The consultancy’s grim analysis shows that plans to commission new solar and wind projects will be delayed this year and cut by an additional 10% next year. Renewables projects in Australia, Brazil, Mexico and South Africa will be particularly affected, as installations now in the procurement phase could face capital cost increases of up to 36% due to the rapid depreciation of local currencies.

Before the coronavirus outbreak, Rystad Energy expected 140 GW of PV and 75 GW of wind capacity to be built in 2020, for a year-on-year increase of 15% and 6%, respectively. However, these projects will now be delayed due to government restrictions on movement that will affect construction time frames.

Rystad Energy expects the impact of the coronavirus to be felt even more acutely from 2021, when the reduction of financial investments and the strengthening of the US dollar will reduce commissioned project capacity by at least 20 GW.

“The foreign-exchange impact will decimate the 2021 outlook for solar installations and the outlook from 2022 and beyond for wind installations, as orders for new equipment will halt from currency-hit emerging countries, which would otherwise account for much of this growth,“ said Gero Farruggio, Rystad Energy’s product manager for renewables.

Supply, demand

Since the onset of the Covid-19 outbreak, mixed reports have emerged about the impact on the global solar market. While PV manufacturing operations are now beginning to return to normal in China, questions remain about the impact on demand.

Analysts from BloombergNEF, PV InfoLink, and IHS Markit say that a significant contraction of demand is likely this year. However, some companies have reported record sales, with consumers reportedly panic-buying solar and storage equipment to shore themselves up in uncertain times.

Deadlines have been relaxed for projects that are still in the construction phase, as developers in some countries have reported that PV development is now at a complete standstill. The French and German governments, for example, have responded to complaints from solar developers by adjusting tender schemes and considering measures to avoid financial penalties and the loss of incentives due to missed deadlines.

Australia’s PV pipeline

According to Rystad Energy, companies that typically procure key project components in US dollars and reap revenue in local currencies may already feel the sting. Utility-scale wind is most at risk, as the percentage of wind development capex procured in US dollars is 25% higher than that of utility-scale PV.

“We expect macroeconomic knock-on effects will reach into 2021 and beyond, with companies pausing on procuring solar PV projects which would have been commissioned in and after 2021,” said Farruggio. “Countries most impacted in this sector will be from emerging markets in Asia, the Middle East, India and Latin America, where the bulk of solar growth had previously been expected.”

In Australia, where the dollar has hit a 17-year low, developers already appear to have cooled on orders that were otherwise imminent, the consultancy says. The country was poised for a record rollout of big PV this year and luckily much of the 2 GW of utility-scale solar expected this year has already been built. However, the country’s long-standing problem of complex grid connections will ultimately determine the cumulative amount of new PV to be connected to the grid this year.

On the other hand, projects seeking financial close will surely stop, Rystad Energy said, reducing the likelihood that the country will achieve its goal of commissioning 1.8 GW of utility-solar PV in 2021. The 1.5 GW worth of approved renewable energy projects scheduled for 2022 also face potential delays, it added.

International impact

In Latin America, Mexico and Brazil have the greatest capacity of utility-solar PV projects under construction and both are experiencing steep currency declines versus the US dollar. Rystad Energy therefore expects procurement to come to a complete halt on most, if not all, projects that have yet to be commissioned. Projects penciled in for commissioning by next year could be indefinitely delayed.

India will not be affected as much as other regions facing depreciation. Rystad Energy had previously estimated that the country would install 5.8 GW of utility-solar PV projects in 2020 and 9.9 GW in 2021.

In Europe, meanwhile, Rystad Energy initially expected more than 20 GW of solar capacity before the crisis. With the euro now sliding against the US dollar, the consultancy says foreign-exchange issues for projects in Europe are not an immediate concern, but could become a problem if the euro falls further.

China and the United States will be the least affected by forex fluctuations, and Rystad Energy expects the number of solar installations in the two countries to remain fairly stable. “Nevertheless, they will undoubtedly feel some slowdown effect, casting doubt on China’s ability to increase its solar capacity by 40 GW as initially forecasted,” it said."	https://www.pv-magazine.com/2020/04/01/covid-19-to-wreck-economics-of-new-solar-wind-projects/
Delayed	"With fears of a trade war easing and major projects such as Simandou in Guinea being rolled out, prospects are encouraging for African mining in 2020. Neil Ford reports

When the US and China signed a preliminary “Phase 1” deal to ease their trade hostilities on 15 January, hopes were high for a stabilisation of the mining commodities market on which many African exporters depend.

Copper was one of the first commodities to see a bounce from the deal, with the DRC and Zambian-mined metal – a bellwether of the global economy – hitting an eight-month high.

With trade war fears easing and major projects due to be rolled out in 2020, the year could be an encouraging one for the African mining industry.

Guinea is on the verge of finally making the most of its vast mining resources, with rapidly rising bauxite production and a long-awaited deal on its long undeveloped Simandou iron ore reserve.

At the same time, South Africa is exploiting its dominant position in the manganese sector, but the region’s diamond exports continue to suffer from dwindling global demand.

And both South Africa and Mozambique are struggling with low coal prices, partly triggered by growing pressure on financial institutions to stop funding coal projects amid a renewed focus on the climate crisis.

Simandou moves forward

The biggest recent development in the African mining sector is Guinea’s approval of mining on half of the giant Simandou iron ore deposit, the biggest proven untapped iron ore resource in the world with estimated reserves of over 2bn tonnes.

Development at Simandou has been repeatedly delayed, with previous concessions mired in legal battles between rival companies and Guinean governments revoking licenses awarded by their predecessors.

In November 2019, Conakry approved a mining plan for blocks 1 and 2 by the Société Minière de Boké-Winning (SMB-Winning) consortium, which comprises aluminium producer Shandong Weiqiao and Yantai Port Group, both of China, the Franco-Guinean company United Mining Supply (UMS), Singa­porean shipping line Winning and Guinea’s state-owned Société Guinéenne du Patrimoine (Soguipami).

The tender was launched in mid-2019, after the government cancelled existing concessions following a high-profile struggle for control between BSG Resources of Israel and Brazilian mining giant Vale.

SMB-Winning prevailed because it promised to fund the infrastructure necessary to ship the ore from a Guinean port – a planned deepwater export port at Matakong will cost $1.5bn to build, plus an estimated $5bn for a railway that will connect the mine and port and another $5bn in increased rail capacity in Phase 2 of the project.

The railway will traverse mountainous terrain, necessitating difficult and costly engineering work, including the construction of bridges and 25km of tunnels. SMB-Winning hopes to complete Phase 1, with production capacity of 60m tonnes/year, by 2026. Output will rise to 110m tonnes/year in Phase 2.

Conakry has insisted that the railway and port be open to other users, making it more likely that a Rio Tinto-led consortium can develop blocks 3 and 4. After more than two decades trying and failing to develop Simandou, Rio Tinto seemed ready to pull out but the recent deal should increase its enthusiasm to strike a deal with the government.

While the long-term outlook at Simandou now looks promising, iron ore prices could slump globally after a strong 2019 which saw the biggest annual gain in three years. New supply from Brazil and Australia is expected to close the supply gap for the key steel ingredient, sending prices lower, while slowing economic growth in China could further weigh on prospects.

Simandou will also strengthen Guinea’s crucial bauxite industry. The country has the world’s largest reserves of the mineral, which is used in the chemical, petrol and cement industries and is the world’s third largest producer. Production reached 60m tonnes in 2018 and continues to rise.

SMB is the biggest bauxite producer in the country, with output of 42m tonnes in 2018. Eurasian Resources and Alufer are both looking to further develop prospects in the country. Guinea Alumina Corporation (GAC) is currently ramping up production on its $1.4bn bauxite project in the Boké region. GAC is owned by Emirates Global Aluminium (EGA), which plans to ship bauxite from Guinea to its new refinery in the United Arab Emirates.

South Africa struggles

Elsewhere, South Africa’s position as the most important mining country in Africa remains under threat. The sector has been hit by years of regulatory uncertainty, strikes and low prices, and has been caught up in corruption scandals.

The introduction of the long-awaited 2018 Mining Charter offered some certainty around the future of the industry and its often-troubled relationship with government, but legal challenges still rumble over the extent of companies’ responsibility for infrastructure and social services for workers.

The South African mining and power sectors remain mired in a troubled relationship. Power shortages caused some mines to halt production in 2019, while the government wants to reduce the price power utility Eskom pays for coal.

The CEO of South Africa’s Minerals Council, Roger Baxter, said in December: “Eskom is essentially making an industrial policy decision to downscale the mining sector.” He called on mining companies to generate more of their own electricity or source it from independent power producers.

But one area where South Africa is making huge progress is in manganese, commonly used in battery production. The amount of manganese transported by Transnet, which is developing a new manganese export terminal in the Eastern Cape, increased from 5m tonnes in 2012-13 to 15.1m tonnes in 2018-19.

The state-owned transport facility has signed 10 long-term transport contracts with mining firms under its Manganese Export Capacity Allocation programme.

With 75% of the world’s reserves, South Africa enjoys a dominant position in the manganese sector. Gold has also been performing strongly amid geopolitical tensions – the safe haven metal hit a seven-year high in January as US-Iran tensions spooked markets. Further turmoil in 2020 could offer cheer for South African gold miners.

Diamonds present another challenge for Southern Africa’s mining executives. In Botswana, where diamonds account for a fifth of GDP, the industry is currently the focus of intense discussions. Negotiations between De Beers and the government are taking place to hammer out a new contract for the sorting, valuing and sale of diamonds from mines run by their joint venture Debswana.

The negotiations are set against a backdrop of weakening global diamond demand, which may allow De Beers to demand more lenient terms. Macroeconomic uncertainty is dragging on consumer spending in the US and China, while cheaper lab-grown rocks are taking market share.

De Beers cut its diamond prices by around 5% at its November sale, according to Bloomberg, in a bid to improve profits for struggling traders and polishers that buy rough stones from the company. The open market price for rough diamonds fell by about 9% in the year to November 2019.

Ultimately, both parties are interested in striking a mutually agreeable deal to continue what has been a successful partnership, but the government is expected to demand more local employment and beneficiation activities.

Climate fears weigh on coal

While new coal-fired power plants are being constructed in Asia, weaker global demand for coal and a growing focus on renewable energy and gas-fired power plants as the climate crisis unfolds have generated fears that Africa’s coal industry could be in terminal decline.

The Mozambican coal industry continues to grow more slowly than hoped because of lower international prices, and the country may never be able to fully exploit its huge coal reserves. The same problems face Botswana, which has plenty of coal but little likelihood of developing it unless prices rebound.

Many of the mines at the heart of the South African coal industry, in Mpumalanga Province, are becoming exhausted, but the Waterberg Basin reserves in the far north of the country are finally being opened up. Transnet has agreed to increase capacity to the Richards Bay Coal Terminal.

However, some progress has been made on developing a Mozambique coal transport corridor. A new port is planned at Macuse, near the mouth of the River Zambezi and 35km north of Quelimane. The project has been under discussion for several years but delayed because of weak global coal prices and the $3.2bn price tag for the port and associated railway.

However, work on building a new village to resettle people living in the proposed project area began in October 2019, increasing the chances of the scheme being developed for an operating consortium led by Thai Moçambique Logistica.

There is more rapid growth in a less heralded part of the Mozambican mining sector – heavy sands. Four big projects have been developed in recent years, most recently by Dingsheng Minerals, which is 85% owned by China’s Anhui Foreign Economic Construction Group, in the south of the country.

International outlook

Yet a 2020 price recovery for many of Africa’s mining commodities could be dependent on the sustainability of the trade truce between the US and China. Should Donald Trump hold his fire in a crucial election year and build on the pragmatic progress of the Phase 1 deal, China-led consumption could underpin a revival. If the erratic president chooses the path of confrontation, miners should expect a rocky ride."	https://africanbusinessmagazine.com/mining/us-china-deal-raises-hopes-for-african-mining-sector/

OSLO (Reuters) - Oil firms Equinor (EQNR.OL) and Husky Energy (HSE.TO) have decided to postpone the Bay du Nord project off Canada due to the fall in oil prices, the Norwegian firm said on Thursday.

The company had previously expected the project with estimated reserves of 300 million barrels to start production in 2025.

“Equinor and partner Husky Energy have decided to defer the Bay du Nord development project offshore Canada to make the project more robust for low commodity prices,” Equinor’s spokesman Morten Eek said in an email to Reuters.

“Equinor will now take the time to further improve the project business case and assess the duration of this deferral,” he added.

Equinor has made no changes to schedules of other projects, including the second phase of its giant Johan Svedrup oilfield development in the North Sea and the Arctic Johan Castberg project, Eek said. Both projects are expected to start in 2022, according to the previously announced schedules.

There hasn’t been any impact on its oil or gas production so far, the spokesman added.

Equinor is Europe’s second largest natural gas supplier after Russia’s Gazprom (GAZP.MM) and accounts for the bulk of oil production from the Norwegian continental shelf, including the share of the Norwegian state.

Oil prices rose on Thursday after falling to their lowest levels in almost two decades the previous day as central banks and governments launched measures to mitigate the fallout from the coronavirus epidemic.

Analysts, however, said the gains were likely to be temporary, as tumbling demand due to the outbreak was compounded by the collapse this month of a deal on supply curbs between OPEC and other producers."	https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-equinor/equinor-delays-bay-du-nord-project-off-canada-after-oil-price-crash-idUSKBN2161LU

The COVID-19 crisis will this year push global solar growth back to 2019 levels as project returns are ""decimated"" by having to fund orders with a value-soaring US dollar, experts have warned.

Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, dynamics including tumbling technology costs and abundant finance had fuelled predictions of a solar boom in 2020, but the advent of the pandemic has forced some to rethink existing forecasts.

Rystad Energy, for one, said this week it had initially expected 140GW of worldwide solar additions in 2020 but has now lowered the figure to 126GW, a repeat of 2019’s number. The consultancy extended the analysis to wind power, set to add 71GW where 75GW had been predicted.

The Oslo-headquartered firm predicted an even bleaker outlook for the years beyond 2020, pointing at impacts from currency value swings. Foreign exchange rates will “decimate” the prospects for solar in 2021 and those of wind players from 2022 and beyond, Rystad said.

Procurement capital cost rises of 'up to 36%' possible

Analysts’ attempts to put a figure on COVID-19’s solar impacts come as anecdotal evidence continues to pile of delays across key markets, including the talk of rising layoffs in the US and the struggle of Italian developers to secure project licenses and bank guarantees.

According to Rystad, the core issue may not be supply chain delays – global shipments have “more or less” arrived as expected, the firm said – as much as the surging value of the US dollar, typically the currency of choice for developers purchasing components.

“Projected returns on developments under procurement are already plummeting as unfavorable exchange rates result in soaring equipment prices,” Rystad said, adding that the risk is greater for utility-scale wind projects, whose capex flows are more US dollar-reliant than solar’s own.

Coupled with nosediving local currencies, the towering of the US dollar could see solar and wind projects pay up to 36% more in capital costs during the procurement phase across certain markets, according to the firm's estimates.

Mexico, Brazil exposed as emerging markets face risks

According to Rystad, the fallout expected around foreign exchange rates will be felt more strongly across emerging renewable markets, from Asia to Latin America and the Middle East.

The firm singled out Mexico and Brazil amongst the worst hit. Both countries may boast large utility-scale solar pipelines but are witnessing declines with local currencies, Rystad said, adding: “Projects hoping to be commissioned in 2021 will be significantly slowed or even indefinitely delayed.”

Elsewhere, India may be less impacted by depreciation while Australia faces a mixed outlook. Work will continue on under-construction PV projects but those in search for finance and components will “surely stop”, Rystad said, pointing at the 17-year low value of Australia’s dollar value.

In addition, the firm believes Chinese and US renewables will be least affected by exchange rate swings while in Europe – where Rystad expected 2020 solar additions of 20GW pre-pandemic – the impacts could aggravate if the Euro’s value continues to drop."	https://www.pv-tech.org/news/covid-19-currency-fallout-to-wipe-out-global-momentum-of-pv-wind-in-2020
Delayed	"The Philippines is facing a projected power shortfall of 800 MW next summer due to delays on two major power plant projects.

Most recently, DMCI Holdings, the parent company of utility Southwest Luzon Power Generation Corp, has reported that a planned expansion of its 600 MW Calaca coal-fired power plant (pictured), located in Batangas, has been delayed.

The project’s first phase will see two 150 MW units built, with another 350 MW unit to follow within three years, bringing the plant’s total capacity to 1250 MW. As it now stands, the first 150 MW unit’s commissioning has been postponed from the set date of June 2015, after a previous postponement from March to June.

Energy secretary Carlos Jericho Petilla was quoted as saying: “DMCI’s plant will be delayed. There was no specific reason but we asked them to explain. My suspicion is that their EPC contractor will not be able to deliver on time”. China National Electric Engineering Co Ltd is the turnkey contractor for the expansion’s first phase.

However, DMCI’s president Nelson Dadivas said that the firm is still targeting a commissioning date of “April to May”. The plant is currently delivering 550 MW to the grid.

“DMCI is fully aware of the looming power crisis in the country and has continuously endeavoured to complete the power plant projects on time to avert or mitigate such crisis with the support of the Department of Energy,” the company said in a prior statement.

Another power project by Australian LNG project development firm Energy World Corporation, the Pagbilao combined-cycle gas-fired plant which was due to come online in December of this year, has also been delayed. The firm’s CEO, Stewart Elliott, told newspaper The Philippine Star that it is now targeting early 2015 for commissioning.

In order to deal with the predicted power shortfall, Petilla has said the Department of Energy is “formalizing a directive that no [existing] power plants are to have scheduled maintenance shutdowns during summer of 2015”."	https://www.powerengineeringint.com/coal-fired/philippines-facing-energy-shortfall-due-to-power-plant-project-delays/

Deputy Minister of Electricity and Energy Khin Maung Win inspected construction of 151-MW power plant in Ahlon Township, Yangon, on March 1st, instructing to complete timely construction of the project to meet schedule, to increase power generation, to meet the set standard of the project, to install the equipments for the early arrival of the equipments and practice worksite safety.

He also laid down the plans to cope with delays as the factories in China were closed and the experts cannot travel to Myanmar due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

Later, the deputy minister and party proceeded to the implementation of 350-MW LNG to Power Thilawa Plant in Kyauktan Township, Yangon Region. They observed the installation of Regasification Unit, 40% completion of jetty construction, linking of gas pipe lines and construction of seven 230-KV pylons.

With the aim to support the power consumption within Summer, plans were underway to generate over 1000-MW electricity from newly seven power plant projects in Magway, Shwe Taung, Kyunchaung, Ahlon, Kyaukphyu, Thanlyin and Tharkayta Townships, according to the Ministry of Electricity and Energy."	https://elevenmyanmar.com/news/govt-faces-hydropower-project-delays-due-to-covid-19

The project director of Golen Gol hydropower project, Mian Faizur Rahman and Pesco representative, Muhammad Nawaz, met the DQM elders and discussed the issue of disruption of the Golen Gol transmission line in Dir.

It may be mentioned that the DQM on Saturday after the All Parties Conference had disconnected the transmission line of the Golen Gol powerhouse in the limits of Upper Dir after the Golen Gol authorities refused to give electricity to Chukiatan gridstation from the project.

The DQM elders and people of Dir had put chains to the transmission line and disconnected it and also announced of a shutdown from September 20 for an unidentified period against the Golen Gol authorities attitude.

They had also announced that the transmission line would remain disconnected until electricity was not given to Chukiatan gridstation from the Golen Gol transmission line. The delegation of Golen Gol and Pesco met the elders of the DQM and after successful dialogues the Golen Gol project director and Pesco representative signed a written accord with the leaders of DQM.

The Golen Gol and Pesco delegation said that work on installation of 132 KV transformer for upgradation of the Chukiatan gridstation to 132 KV from 66 KV would be started from September 25 this year. And also installation of the remaining poles of the Golen Gol transmission line to Chukiatan gridstation would also be started from the same date.

After the successful negotiations, the DQM announced to postpone the shutdown. However, its leaders announced that the transmission line would continue to be disconnected until the Golen Gol and Pesco authorities fulfilled their promises."	https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/369943-golen-qol-project-shutdown-postponed%20shutdown%20postponed
Delayed	"LAHORE: The completion of Neelum-Jhelum hydropower project has been delayed further, as it is now expected to be fully operational in June instead of earlier completion date of April 2018, an announcement said on Thursday.

The formal launching of 969MW Neelum-Jhelum hydropower project has also been delayed further.

Against the earlier date of February 2018 for commissioning of the first power generation unit of Neelum-Jhelum hydropower project, the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) has announced that the first unit of the project is now scheduled to go into operation by early March 2018.

The commissioning of power generation units was earlier to be done from February to April 2018. However, the first unit of the project is scheduled to go into operation by early March 2018; followed by the second, third and fourth units at one month interval, respectively. Hence, the project would be fully operational in June 2018 instead of April.

According to Wapda, Neelum-Jhelum hydropower project is in final stage of completion, as most of the major milestones, which were required to be completed prior to the commissioning of the project, have successfully been achieved.

These milestones included completion of dam and start of water filling in the reservoir, completion of waterway system, comprising 51.5km long tunnels, installation of turbines, generators, transformers and other electro-mechanical equipment in the powerhouse, the switchyard, and dry testing of electro-mechanical equipment.

The National Transmission and Dispatch Company’s transmission line is expected to be completed by the end of this month, while water filling (pressurisation) of waterway system will commence during the first week of January 2018, the announcement said.

In the first phase, water filling (pressurisation) will commence from the tail-end, it added.

Meanwhile, Wapda Chairman Lt Gen Muzammil Hussain (Retd) visited Neelum-Jhelum hydropower project. During the two-day visit, the Wapda chairman reviewed the construction work on dam site, head race tunnel, underground power house and tail race tunnel.

Reviewing the construction activities on various sites of the project, Lt Gen Hussain said that the ongoing dry tests of electrical and mechanical installations and pressurisation of the tail race tunnel are of paramount importance.

With this in view, the laid down parameters relating to the safety of the project should be taken into account in such a way that the pace of work is not compromised, he added.

He reiterated that Wapda is committed to complete this and other under-contraction hydropower projects in the shortest possible time.

The Wapda chairman said it is a matter of satisfaction that the long-awaited Neelum-Jhelum hydropower project is getting ready for generation after inordinate delay spread over years.

The project is being constructed on River Neelum in Azad Jammu and Kashmir. It is an engineering marvel with 90 percent of the project being underground in the high mountain areas.

The project consists of four units with installed capacity of 969MW. On its completion, it will contribute around five billion units of electricity to the national grid annually with over Rs50 billion revenue injection in the national exchequer."	https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/261698-neelum-jhelum-hydropower-project-delayed-%20further
Delayed	"First, it was delay on the part of India that held up implementation of key India-sponsored infrastructure projects in Myanmar. Now, delay in getting due permissions from Myanmar is holding up work on the ₹2,904-crore Kaladan multi-modal transport project.

Kaladan is the single largest development activity undertaken by India in a foreign country.

In June this year, IRCON International awarded the contract for building the 109-km-long road connecting Paletwa river terminal in Rakhine State to Zorinpui on the Mizoram border. The construction was expected to start after the monsoon in October, but it didn’t.

At a recent conference organised by the Institute of Social and Cultural Studies (ISCS) and Myanmar government think-tank MISIS, in Yangon, Indian Ambassador Vikram Misri said the construction is waiting for “some approvals” from the Myanmar government. Misri did not elaborate on the nature of approvals but, he hoped that the work would start soon. However, the delay may cost heavy due to the narrow weather window available in the region.

Meanwhile, the prolonged delay in completing the road project and the lack of captive cargo is diminishing the viability of existing Indian investments in Sittew Port and Paletwa river terminal, a part of the Kaladan project.

India completed the port development, with six-metre assured draft, in early 2016. As per the bilateral agreement, the port was handed over to the local government.

Almost two years down the line, the port has lost its navigability as draft is down to barely one metre. Sources in both India and Myanmar blame it on prolonged disuse and failure on the part of Myanmar to continue dredging activities.

As a corrective measure, India is now trying to amend the agreement to bring the port under joint operations.

Meanwhile, construction of the ₹1,173-crore road project from Kalwa to Yargi in Myanmar by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is yet to take off. The project is part of the Trilateral Highway project that will connect Moreh in Manipur with Mae Sot in Thailand.

In early September, NHAI identified the potential EPC contractor for the project through competitive bidding. However, work order couldn’t be issued till availability of at least 80 per cent unencumbered land. Sources, however, told BusinessLine that Myanmar has promised to make necessary arrangements soon. The upgradation of 71 bridges on Tamu-Kalewa-Kalemyo section of the proposed Trilateral Highway is yet to take off either. Though IRCON identified a potential EPC contractor, the bid value of ₹293 crore exceeded the budgetary allocation of ₹280 crore.

Thokchom Jotin Singh, general secretary of the Manipur Chamber of Commerce and Industry, however, confirmed that the construction may start in December as the government is escalating the budget."	https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/logistics/delay-in-myanmar-approvals-holds-up-kaladan-road-project/article9970931.ece
Delayed	"The Narendra Modi government is finally on course to completing the $484-million Kaladan multi-modal transport projects in Myanmar that will offer connectivity to Mizoram in India. Kaladan was the first major project taken up by India in Myanmar.

According to sources, a ₹1,600-crore contract has been awarded for building 109-km road connecting Paletwa river terminal to Zorinpui in Mizoram border. The construction is expected to start after the monsoon in October.

India completed the construction of Sittwe port, at the estuary of Kaladan river, in trouble-prone Rakhine state of Myanmar, last year, one year behind schedule. Construction of the river terminal 158 km upstream and dredging of the river to ensure navigability are in the final stages.

At the Indian side, extension of the Aizawl-Saiha National Highway by 90 km to the international border at Zorinpui, at the southern tip of Mizoram, is almost over.

It was one of the most challenging road projects taken up in this part of the country, in decades.

Also, a ₹6,000-crore project is under way for four-laning of the 300 km Aizawl-Tuipang highway to ensure faster movement of goods between Sittwe and Mizo capital of Aizawl in the North West which is close to the Barak Valley of Assam.

However, absence of the road link between Paletwa and Zorinpui led to doubts over the utility of such huge investments on either side of the border. Sources told BusinessLine that not a single ship has called at the Sittwe port so far.

Mooted in 2003, India entered a framework agreement with Myanmar for Kaladan project in 2008. Construction began in 2010 with a deadline in June 2015. But, no headway was achieved on the road project.

Inadequate fund allocation and planning failure were seen as major reasons for the delay.

In October 2015, the Narendra Modi government revised the budget estimates by nearly six times to ₹2,904 crore and roped in State-owned Ircon Infrastructure and Services Ltd as consultant with an aim to complete the project in 2019.

However, finding a contractor became an issue. Last year, the project was tendered twice but without success. Sources say the logjam was broken recently as the project was awarded to a Delhi-based firm C & C Constructions.

While C&C could not be contacted, sources said the contractor would mobilise men and machine during the monsoon and open offices at Sittwe, Paletwa and Yangon in Myanmar.

According to sources, as per the framework agreement, India should also set up an SEZ at Sittwe, which is located closer to the Chinese port and SEZ at Kyaukphyu.

In 2015, the Ministry of External Affairs appointed a consultant to explore the possibility. A suitable land was also identified in Sittwe. This is important to promote Indian investment in the region overriding strong Chinese influence.

However, no movement is reported on this issue since."	https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/national/india-awards-road-contract-to-complete-kaladan-project-in-myanmar/article9723297.ece

Alstom will provide four 175 MW Francis turbine-generator sets and related equipment. Alstom Hydro China (AHC) is responsible for the equipment design, manufacturing, supervision to the installation, commissioning, testing as well as site services, Alstom said this week.

Located on the middle and upper reaches of River Kaduna near Zungeru in Niger state, Zungeru Hydropower Project will become the country’s largest hydropower project once operated, with 700MW installed capacity in total.

“Zungeru is one of several hydro projects that are part of Nigeria’s Renewable Energy Master Plan. We are honoured to participate in such a grand agenda,” said Yves Rannou, Hydro Senior Vice President of Alstom Renewable Energies.

Construction on the $1.3bn power plant began in 2013 and is scheduled for completion by the end of 2017.

It is being built by CNEEC and China’s Sinohydro.

Seventy-five percent of the funding comes from China Export Import Bank and the remaining 25% by the Nigerian Power Sector Intervention Fund.

Last July angry youths from surrounding communities halted work in protest over what they claimed was unfair compensation for people displaced by the dam.

Delayed	"ISLAMABAD: In another shocking development, the 969MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project, whose cost has swelled to whopping Rs414 billion, has been delayed by another seven to eight months in the wake of government’s failure in achieving the financial closure.

In the case, financial closure of the project, which has been completed by 74.5 per cent, is achieved today, then all the turbines of project will go on test run by end of next year, one of the top men in Wapda told The News. The earlier timeline for the project completion was Nov 2016 which has now been extended to July-August 2017. But even if the required amount of almost $1.576 billion is ensured now, the project will be on test run by end of next calendar year. However, the delay can be reduced to seven to eight months by working round the clock.

China’s EXIM bank has linked the release of $576 million to Pakistan to the approval of revised PC-1 of the project with a cost of Rs414 billion by Ecnec (Executive Committee of National Economic Council) as the CDWP (Central Development Working Party) has already recommended the project with the new cost.

Likewise, a local banks’ consortium headed by National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) has also argued that it will provide the Rs100 billion (around $1 billion) loan the moment Ecnec approves the project.

However, the Nawaz government that wants the project to be completed by 2016-end has failed to achieve the financial closure.

However, Wapda Chairman Zafar Mehmood, when contacted, in a cautious response said the project was facing financial constraints. “If the financial closure gets achieved today then the project will be functional some time by the end of 2017.” However, he remained tight lipped when asked as to when the financial closure will be achieved.

Younas Dagha - secretary water and power - didn’t respond when he was sent an SMS containing the question: Is there any development that the Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project has

delayed by 7-8 months because of the government’s failure in achieving financial closure? The correspondent made several calls on his cell phone, but it remained unattended. However, the top official said: “We are spending more money out of the budgeted amount that was to be spent by Wapda’s own resources and keeping the project afloat so that the contractor could not make its mind to leave the project.”

The PC-1 has been revised thrice and the project is 74.5 per cent complete in the absence of financial closure. So in this way, this project is one of its own kind.

“So far a huge amount of Rs180 billion has been spent on the project out of which Rs 39 billion is being generated through Neelum-Jhelum Surcharge imposed on electricity bills.”

In 2002, the official says, the project cost was Rs84 billion, but its design had to be modified after the 2005 earthquake,, keeping in view the fault lines passing through the site, while the scale of the project also expanded.

Furthermore, the cost escalated to Rs274 billion due to the rising value of dollar. Now, it is the third time that the project cost has be revised upward to Rs414 billion mainly because of the inclusion of duties, taxes and IDC (interests during cost) till completion of the project and the cost of the consultant.

The 86 per cent increase in the cost is because of the IDC and 7 per cent in the wake of consultancy fee. So far, 74.5 per cent construction work has been completed on the site. “We have constructed the tunnel beneath the bed of River Jhelum, which will be connected to the tunnel coming from the dam site by end of January 2016.”

Moreover, transformers and mechanical equipment has been installed in powerhouse, while power pylons are being installed in the switch yard from where electricity will be transmitted to the Gujranwala grid station.

The tunnel excavation has been completed by 86 per cent as 59-km tunnel has been constructed. At the dam site, 72 per cent construction work has been completed, including the construction of spillway up to level of 1019 meters, wherein one hydraulic gate has been installed and the second one will also be in place in next two months.

The tunnel boarding machines (TBMs) have the target to excavate the 22.5-km tunnel out of which 13.5-km has been done. The official said the project was earlier delayed by six months because of the rock burst at the site owing to which three workers died and nine were injured.

Delayed	"A major reason for delay in execution of the Chabahar port project is due to delays from the Iranian side, said former Foreign Secretary S. Jaishankar in his first comments since stepping down from the post in January.

“In the case of Chabahar, I know we always like to beat up on ourselves. But to be very honest a lot of the problems were because the Iranians kept changing the terms of the agreement. I mean they changed it in very fundamental ways at least about three times in the last three years,” Dr. Jaishankar said while delivering the ‘Jasjit Singh memorial lecture on national security’ organised by the Centre for Air Power Studies.

Dr. Jaishankar who is now the President, Global Corporate Affairs of the Tata group, was talking about the changes in the Indian foreign policy of which he said the major change over the last 3-4 years was project execution. The other changes according to him are financing and delegation of powers.

Gateway to Afghanistan

India which sees Chabahar’s Shahid Beheshti port as a gateway to Afghanistan and Central Asia, has committed $85 million on the current phase of construction, and a total of $500 million on the project.

On the delay in execution of projects by India in many countries, Dr. Jaishankar said often “the conceptualisation of projects had been flawed.”

“If you look at where our projects haven’t done well, these are hardworking environments,” he said giving the example of Myanmar, where India is implementing the Kaladan multimodal transit transport project. Despite looming U.S. sanctions over oil imports from Iran, India has expressed confidence that the project would be operational by 2019."	https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/chabahar-port-project-delayed-due-to-iran-jaishankar/article24455469.ece
Delayed	"LAHORE: The Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) has so far failed to get civil work initiated on the 128MW Keyal Khwar hydropower project (KKHP) despite paying 50 per cent of the mobilisation advance to the contractor about two years ago.

The project, scheduled for completion next year as per the original plan, got attention of the authority after the Prime Minister’s Office sought report on delayed hydropower projects, forcing senior officials to quickly issue commencement order to the contractor last month to mobilise machinery, equipment, labour, etc, on the site.

The project is now expected to be completed in January 2020 and its cost has increased more than four times the original PC-1 cost. The project — a concrete gravity dam — is located along Keyal Khwar, a right bank tributary of the Indus in Kohistan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. M/S Lahmeyer International — the lead partner of a joint venture — has been appointed as consultant of the project.

A senior Wapda official, however, claimed that the project was delayed because local people had stopped Chinese engineers from entering the site till the construction of a grid station for smooth supply of electricity to them.

“The project was delayed due to locals and not us as they wanted work on installation of a 132kV grid station to go ahead simultaneously with the construction of KKHP,” Wapda’s member (water) Eng Mohammad Shoaib Iqbal told Dawn.

But an official source blames incompetence and negligence on the part of senior officials for the delay, questioning why they had failed when everything (land acquisition, mobilisation advance, preparatory works, etc) had been completed two years ago.

“The project’s detailed design was ready in 2010 while the process for prequalification of contractors and tendering commenced in 2011. Similarly, construction of a staff colony and camp offices was launched and simultaneously completed about three years earlier,” says an official.

He said the contractors — M/s Sinohydro-Hajvairy JV (civil works) and M/s Sarwar & Company Private Limited (powerhouse ventilation tunnel exploratory audit) — were selected through a bidding process in 2012. However, agreements for the project between the government and the contractors were signed in 2014 after Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau Bank (Germany) and the European Investment Bank pledged to fund the project in association with the federal government.

The official said the process of land acquisition for the project’s power house had been completed in 2011, but the failure to start civil work was a question mark on those entrusted with the task of completing power projects on a fast track.

He feared that the delay might provide an opportunity to the contractor to charge escalation cost, besides revision of the project cost. “The contractor may demand payment of escalation cost worth millions of rupees on the pretext of completing the preparatory arrangements related to deployment of labour, manpower, vehicles, etc,” the official said, adding that appeared to be a win-win situation for the contractor.

Wapda member Shoaib Iqbal admitted that it was true that the mobilisation advance to the contractor had been paid two years ago. “But it is also true that the problem doesn’t exist on our part. Actually it was difficult to fulfil the locals’ demand for constructing the grid station since it doesn’t come under our purview,” he said. “Therefore, we requested Pesco to fulfil the public demand, but it couldn’t do so. And finally, the cost of the grid station was also included in the revised cost estimate for the KKHP.”

He said Wapda had taken up the issue with the federal government and informed it that a local MNA was behind the protests in Pattan and Bisham. On the other hand, he added, the lead partner of joint venture, Sinohydro-Hajvairy, had some problem with its JB partner — Ms Hajvairy. But this issue has also been resolved.

Nigeria has announced that the completion of a 150km major railway project linking Lagos to Ibadan has been delayed by the coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak as workers from China had not returned to the country.

The railway line is being developed by the state-owned China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation, reported South China Morning Post.

Nigeria’s Transport Minister Rotimi Amaechi said: “Most of the Chinese workers who went on their New Year holiday have not yet returned due to the coronavirus and this has delayed the work.”

Expected to be completed in May, the $1.5bn project has been repeatedly facing delays since it was first agreed in 2012.

China has since invested billions of dollars in constructing infrastructure across Africa, building its influence in the region.



Nigeria has currently reported only one case in an Italian man who travelled from Milan to Lagos.

Despite its strong business connections with China, sub-Saharan Africa has been lightly impacted by the coronavirus. The number of countries with coronavirus reached 100 on 9 March, in less than three months of the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak in China in December 2019.

More than a quarter (26.5%) of the confirmed global Covid-19 cases are currently outside China.

Furthermore, the daily number of cases reported outside China are currently higher than those reported in the country, signifying the global spread and possible worsening of the epidemic in the near future."	https://www.railway-technology.com/news/completion-of-1-5bn-nigeria-project-delays-due-to-covid-19-outbreak/
Delayed	"LAHORE, June 26: As if the inordinate two-year delay already suffered by 106-MW Golen Gol Hydropower Project was not enough, the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) has again started delaying re-bidding process.

What makes the delay unpardonable is not only the financial cost (over Rs5.5 billion a year) of cheap hydel power, but also the fact that it were problems in the tendering process that put off the lenders and activated the Transparency International and the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) against the process.

Unfortunately, the Wapda is at it again. Under instructions from the NAB and the Ministry of Water Power, the Wapda started the re-bidding process earlier this year. The bids were due to be opened on May 30. Without assigning any reason, the Wapda delayed the opening till June 14. On June 14, it was again delayed to June 24. On June 24, the participants were told that it would now be opened on July 4.

According to the critics, the authority, as it did last time, might be trying to bring in some new company and allowing it time to prepare qualifying documents. The Wapda, however, denies such allegations. “The authority is waiting for the concurrence of the lenders (Kuwait Development Fund),” says a Wapda spokesman.

The participating bidders doubt this version. Why the authority needs approval for a bid? It is not awarding the contract anyway, says one of the bidders. Even if such a concurrence was required, it should have sought prior to inviting bids. Why it needs such an approval two months after initiating the process, the Wapda should explain.

It is a case of once bitten, twice shy, he insists. The authority has already wasted two crucial years, when it had to scrap the entire bidding process in 2011-12 because it failed to keep transparency and its wrongdoings were documented by a two-member inquiry committee of the Ministry of Water and Power.

It found Wapda guilty of “numerous discrepancies and procedural anomalies” in award of Golen Gol Hydropower Project. In its “confidential report” (No1(6)DS(a)/2012), the Fact Finding Inquiry Committee maintained that the “bid evaluation was not according to the relevant clauses of instructions provided in the tender document. After careful scrutiny of evidence and material on record, it is proven that the bid was postponed several times (as per the critics, for accommodating some unqualified but favourite few). The prolonged delay in the opening of tender for six months is neither understandable, not justified.”

“The process later adopted by the Wapda for prequalification of bidders was not approved prior to the bidding process – which is a glaring anomaly, and against the spirit of the pre-qualification process.”

Despite the delay in execution of the project and the authority being held guilty of violating bidding process, Wapda is doing it yet again. Delaying bid opening four times so far in the last one month, and repeating exactly what did the damage last time.The 106-MW Golen Gol Hydropower project, located on River Golen Gol – a tributary of the River Mastuj in Chitral district of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa – has been under the tendering and re-tendering process since June 30, 2011. But the authority has not been able to complete it in the last 24 months."	https://www.dawn.com/news/1028178/re-biddinq-for-qolen-qol-project-delayed-aqain%20

Updated: Feb 05, 2020 18:20 IST

In just six years, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made 13 official visits to neighbouring countries (excluding China), compared to just five by Manmohan Singh in 10 years. This included the first bilateral State visit to Sri Lanka in almost 40 years, if one excludes Rajiv Gandhi’s 1987 short trip to seal the military intervention. Such intense political outreach reflects the urgency of India’s regional connectivity strategy, also known as Neighbourhood First.

Unfortunately, much of the analysis has focused on whether a “pro-China” or “anti-India” leader has taken over power in Kathmandu or Colombo. Such a narrow geostrategic focus misses the many small successes on the ground that have silently enhanced connectivity with the neighbours. Over a dozen Integrated Check Posts are being built to facilitate trade and mobility along the borders with Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar.

In 2019, India and Nepal inaugurated South Asia’s first cross-border oil pipeline and, for the first time, Bhutanese cargo reached Bangladesh on an Indian river vessel. Following upgradation with Indian aid, the airport at Jaffna, in northern Sri Lanka, was reconnected with a direct flight from South India after more than four decades. Finally, the launch of the South Asian Satellite by the Indian Space Research Organisation enhanced digital connectivity across the region.

These are just a few examples indicating how connectivity has become the new consensus across the Indian government, and is making unprecedented progress, beyond just political summits, statements and slogans. But keeping this momentum will not be easy, with a variety of challenges on the horizon.

First, Modi’s political initiative has exposed significant implementation deficiencies and policy coordination challenges between various ministries. With Myanmar, for example, the Trilateral Highway and Kaladan projects have been delayed for almost two decades, affecting India’s reputation. Delhi will also have to do a better job at roping in India’s border states, which are the main stakeholders in deepening cross-border linkages.

Second, China cannot be blamed for doing its own part. Pressuring Nepal or Sri Lanka to limit their economic relations with China because of intangible “security concerns” is no longer sustainable. These countries will continue to balance Beijing and Delhi and, as the late strategist K Subrahmanyam noted, Delhi must thus take a “relaxed view” because “in the longer run the imperatives of geography, cultural affinities, international politics … will bring home to our neighbours the facts of life and of realpolitik.” India may never be loved in neighbouring countries, but it can certainly be respected for delivering more, better and faster to support developmental objectives.

Third, for all the investment in physical infrastructure of roads or ports, the region will not integrate unless India opens up its market and embraces the logic of economic interdependence. There are no short-cuts to the slow process of bottom-up integration of cross-border sectors such as transportation, electricity or water. This also requires short-term sacrifices that will hurt protectionist lobbies at home, especially when it comes to reducing trade barriers. The recent hike in import tariffs has sent the wrong signal to Bangladesh and there has also been no progress on the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement with Sri Lanka.

Fourth, South Asia is no longer India’s exclusive backyard and there are important new players that can support India in developing Indo-Pacific alternatives to China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Especially with Japan, India embraced an ambitious agenda of trilateral cooperation, of which Sri Lanka’s Colombo port terminal is the best example, but Delhi seems to have bitten off more than it can chew. Greater exchange of information and coordination may be more effective than pushing for more joint projects in third countries. Similarly, within the region, while keeping the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation in the freezer makes sense until relations normalise with Pakistan, India will have to complement its bilateral track with other neighbours with greater investment in regional institutions, whether the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (Bimstec) or the Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal Initiative (BBIN).

Fifth, cultural and religious values have taken a front seat in Neighbourhood First, which incessantly promotes India as a civilisational hub. But emphasising alikeness is often counterproductive with smaller neighbours, where identity politics favour distinctiveness and also fuel anxiety about greater linkages with India. In addition, will India be able to keep the ideological high ground to pressure neighbours on democratisation and inclusiveness? In the past, Delhi took up the causes of the Tamils in Sri Lanka and the Madhesis in Nepal, but these have been losing salience in the name of economic and security pragmatism.

Finally, regional connectivity will only succeed if India invests in increasing its knowledge about the region. South Asian and neighbourhood studies have been neglected for decades at Indian universities and there is a generational gap of experts, for example on the rapidly changing political, economic and social dynamics of Nepal or Myanmar.

Constantino Xavier is a fellow at Brookings India, New Delhi. He is a leading a research initiative, Sambandh, on regional connectivity across sectors.

Delayed	"BANGKOK: Incomplete and prospective hydropower dam projects in Southeast Asia, particularly along the Mekong River and its tributaries, are at risk of major delays and shutdowns as the COVID-19 pandemic impacts major industries, energy markets and worker safety.

The government of Laos has already ordered a temporary halt to all hydropower construction in the country, after a mining company worker tested positive for the virus. Planning consultations about future works, including the major Luang Prabang dam, have also been postponed.

Amid possibly the worst regional drought in four decades and the worsening impacts of climate change, observers say the virus-driven impacts have further put the viability of large scale projects in question.

“Everyone is affected. The global economy is affected. The hydro sector is affected. The pandemic will hamper global supply chains, delay construction and temporarily reduce demand,” the Mekong River Commission (MRC) Secretariat told CNA.

“But the extent of the impact will depend on how far the pandemic will go. At this time, there are a lot of uncertainties. Nobody is sure when this is going to end,” it continued.

FALLING DEMAND FOR ELECTRICITY

Meantime Thailand, a major importer of electricity from neighbouring countries, is set to slash its overseas purchases, faced with a serious oversupply of domestic power due to a steep decline in demand.

The country’s Ministry of Energy will be forced to adjust its power development plan with oversupplied reserves set to hit 40 per cent - or about 18,000 MW, a situation that is likely to see power prices soar for consumers.

“To put this in perspective, 18,000 MW is over three times what Thailand is currently importing from neighbouring countries; and is greater than the combined installed capacity of 11 dams planned for the Lower Mekong mainstream,” said Pianporn Deetes, Thailand Campaign Coordinator for non-government organisation, International Rivers.

“It is clear that buying electricity from large-scale dams is not necessary to ensure Thailand’s energy security,” she said, while urging for a moratorium on the signing of Power Purchase Agreements on new power projects in neighbouring countries.

Economic pressures and energy market dynamics are expected to majorly impact hydropower in the region. (Photo: Jack Board)

For Laos, which has positioned itself to be the battery of Southeast Asia, the risks and costs are already mounting. While existing projects, including the expansive but controversial Xayaburi Dam can continue to operate freely, its power production, which is managed for export by Thailand’s national energy utility EGAT, will be surplus to needs during this period.

“As COVID-19 is force majeure, people in the sector can renegotiate contract arrangements to make it flexible enough to cope with this situation,” the MRC Secretariat said.

UNCERTAIN PROGNOSIS FOR HYDROPOWER INDUSTRY

Climate change is already biting in Laos and it is one of the reasons the government has admitted it needs to more carefully review its hydropower dependency. Recent reports that China had deliberately withheld water on its portions of the Mekong - which it refers to as Lancang - contributing to weak flow and dry river conditions downstream, have exacerbated concerns about the dams’ reliability.

An MRC report shows a predicted mean temperature rise of about 0.8 degrees Celsius by 2030, a number set to rise incrementally throughout the remainder of the century, each increase raising the magnitude and stakes of the impact.

It also cites a 50 per cent drop in annual Mekong river flow through Laos’ capital city Vientiane over the next 40 years, under a “dried climate scenario”.

Cambodia has already put a moratorium on mainstream Mekong projects for a decade. (Photo: Jack Board)

The permanent secretary of Laos’ Ministry of Energy and Mines told CNA late last year that solar projects were being considered as a complement or substitute to unreliable hydro production.

“It’s very difficult now to operate or focus the output of the hydropower. We have to think more deeply, more broadly and think if we can develop it this way, or another way,” Dr Daovong Phonekeo said then.

Daine Loh, a power and renewables analyst for Fitch Solutions also said: “Unexpected droughts and weather patterns have weakened hydropower generation output reliability in recent years, so some markets might look to other more reliable baseload resources such as coal or gas generation to support their economic growth over the coming years.”

“The weaker fiscal position of these markets due to an economic slowdown also poses a significant downside risk to the completion of new large-scale hydroelectric power projects over the medium term, increasing the risk of delays and cancellations most prominently on primarily government-funded projects,” she added.

The Mekong has been suffering from low flows and appeared a blue-green colour late last year due to sedimentation loss. (Photo: Jack Board)

Cambodia is one country already turning its back on large-scale mainstream dams, with its government last month postponing new projects on the Mekong for a decade. It means two potential projects - the Stung Treng and Sambor - are unlikely to go ahead.

The country suffered major electricity shortages during last year’s dry season and while exploration of other renewable energy sources are in early exploratory phases, the allure of reliable, affordable production may put short-term importance on coal power plants.

“The current low gas prices, for instance, is tempting for many countries seeking cheaper electricity,” said the MRC secretariat.

“But the recent volatility in the oil markets has once again highlighted the relative stability of cash flows that renewable energy projects, in particular hydropower, can deliver to investors over the long run.”

Seventy-five per cent of the total workload has been completed, he added.Usually, after the municipal People’s Committee signs a decision to adjust the capital of the two metro line projects, the central government will disburse the money. But the procedures for money transfer and payment take time, so the city is expected to receive the money in March or April next year, Hoan said.The city has advanced a 1.7 trillion VND payment to investors, construction units and labourers so that work on the project can continue.Metro line No 1 was approved by the city in April 2007 with an investment of 17.4 trillion VND (766.4 million USD). After investment costs were re-calculated by consulting agencies, costs increased to more than 47.3 trillion USD in 2010.Meanwhile, metro line No 2 connecting Ben Thanh and Tham Luong in district 12 is now scheduled to open in 2026, a two-year delay from its 2024 goal./.	https://en.vietnamplus.vn/costs-for-hcm-citys-first-metro-line-reduced-by-147-million-usd/163740.vnp

Delayed	"Workers and materials stuck in China amid the coronavirus outbreak will delay work on Indonesia’s $6bn high-speed railway from Jakarta to Bandung, a project official said.

Around 300 Chinese staff went home for the Lunar New Year and could not return after Indonesia banned flights to and from China.

“The problem is many of those who returned to China are at senior levels and this has affected decision making,” said Chandra Dwiputra, managing director of the Chinese-Indonesian joint venture building the railway, PT Kereta Api Cepat Indonesia China (KCIC).

Project directors, managers, engineers and consultants are among the absent Chinese workers.

“I can’t talk about targets for this year,” Chandra added, reports Radio Free Asia (RFA).

Two thousand of the project’s 14,000 workforce are Chinese nationals.

More trouble is caused by the fact that nearly 50% of materials, including pipes, waterproofing and signalling equipment are made in China.

Their supply has been interrupted by the shutdown of manufacturing in China as authorities sought to contain the outbreak.

Chandra said: “Concrete, steel and some other materials are available here, but if there are no supporting materials, construction will be disrupted.”

He has asked contractors to replace Chinese workers with Indonesians temporarily.

“The point is I am encouraging contractors to adjust plans according to the current conditions,” he said.

Elsewhere, in North Sumatra, construction of a hydroelectric power plant has been suspended because of the absence of Chinese workers, reports RFA.

The Rapid Transit System Link, which will bridge one of the world’s busiest border crossings, can carry up to 10,000 passengers an hour each way - more than 30 times the capacity of the existing train service.

The project will cost 3.16 billion ringgit ($757 million), down from 4.93 billion ringgit under the original proposal, a reduction of 36%, Mahathir said.

“We will build this railway, the agreement has been made. Half will be built by Singapore, the other half will be built by us,” Mahathir told reporters at the Malaysia-Singapore border.

“The details will be discussed with Singapore.”

Singapore’s transport ministry said it welcomed Malaysia’s decision.

“Both sides are now discussing the changes to the project, which Malaysia is proposing in order to reduce the project cost ... the discussions will take some time,” the ministry said in a statement.

The train project was originally suspended in May as Malaysia, saddled with more than $200 billion in debt, reassessed projects agreed under the previous administration. A further delay was agreed last month.

The Southeast Asian neighbors last year scrapped a high-speed rail project linking Singapore to the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur, which analysts estimated would cost around $17 billion.

Tensions often run high between Malaysia and Singapore, and Mahathir took a swipe at the city-state for not agreeing to a new road bridge between the two countries that he believes is the solution to congestion.

An estimated 300,000 people travel along the main highway between Johor and Singapore every day, the primary crossing between two countries, which separated from each other in 1965.

Singapore relies on Malaysia for around half of its fresh water and Mahathir threatened to increase the price.

“We are willing to sacrifice our money to support Singapore so that they can buy cheap water for themselves, but when we want to build a bridge to solve the traffic problem, they refuse,” he said.

“I don’t see why we are accommodating to Singapore when they’re not accommodating to us.”"	https://www.reuters.com/article/us-malaysia-singapore-railway/malaysia-singapore-rail-link-back-on-at-lower-cost-mahathir-idUSKBN1XA11R
Delayed	"Malaysia informed Singapore yesterday afternoon that it has remitted $15 million as payment for the abortive costs the Republic incurred as a result of the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High-Speed Rail (HSR) project being suspended.

Singapore's Ministry of Transport (MOT), in response to media queries, said yesterday it has received confirmation from the Malaysian government, through diplomatic correspondence, that the reimbursement has been made.

The amount was agreed last September when both countries inked a deal to suspend the HSR project for about two years, up to May 31, 2020. The reimbursement was to be made by the end of last month.

Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad had initially wanted to scrap the HSR as part of a review of his country's mega projects, in a bid to trim a RM1 trillion (S$329 billion) national debt.

However, a deal was negotiated to suspend the project instead as a cancellation would have entailed a high amount of compensation under the HSR agreement signed between the two countries.

With the delay, the HSR express service will start running only on Jan 1, 2031, instead of Dec 31, 2026, as planned initially.

The 350km HSR link would cut travelling time between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore to 90 minutes, compared with more than four hours by car.

Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan told Parliament last October that the abortive costs include contract breakage costs, which Singapore has to pay to contractors for terminating ongoing projects, and to wind down operations.

For ongoing excavation works, for example, the excavations must be back-filled for the site to be safe, and re-excavated when the project resumes, thus increasing costs, Mr Khaw said.

Up to the end of May last year, Singapore had spent more than $250 million to implement the HSR project, which included costs for consultancies to design the civil infrastructure, costs for manpower and costs for land acquisition.

More than $6 million in costs was incurred in June, another sum of more than $6 million in July, and at least $40 million is projected to have been spent from August to the end of last year.

Mr Khaw has said that Singapore can recover value for some of the expenditure, even if the HSR project does not proceed.

""But a significant amount which has been spent will be completely wasted expenditure if the project does not proceed,"" he told Parliament last July."	https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/deferred-hsr-deal-kl-informs-spore-of-15m-remittance

Delayed	"The condition of the 375km Abuja-Kano, road which passes through Kaduna and Zaria towns, has continued to deteriorate even as reconstruction of the dual carriage highway is suffering from undue delay.

Different reasons have been given as to why work on the project is sluggish, including alleged poor funding by the federal government occasioned by failure of the contractor, Julius Berger Nigeria Plc, to deploy enough equipment and manpower to fast track the reconstruction of the road.

The House of Representatives Committee on Works, led by Abubakar Kabir Abubakar, had last week tongue-lashed the construction giant, which is solely handling the project, for subjecting millions of Nigerians to hardship while plying the road, and threatened to split the contract and bring on board other contractors to hasten completion.

Accidents leading deaths are a recurring decimal along the road which is dotted with hundreds of potholes, diversions and other obstructions.

The Federal Executive Council (FEC) had in December 2017 approved the contract for the reconstruction of the road but work commenced in July 2018.

The contract was awarded at the sum of N155 billion with a completion period of 36 months.

Julius Berger has so far received over N50 billion, representing 32 per cent of the total budget for the road, Daily Trust learnt.

Progress of work on the road is said to be at 26.7 per cent, 18 months into the 36-month completion period.

Our correspondents in Abuja, Kaduna, Zaria and Kano, who travelled over the road and closely monitored the progress, report that while reconstruction work has been slow, the degradation that necessitated the award of the contract had continued due to weather conditions, traffic congestion and lack of maintenance.

Many portions of the road have been eroded with pot holes and gullies forming in the middle and cracks of different sizes across its length and breadth.

Long stretches of what used to be road shoulders have been washed off while large portions have disappeared.

Investigations carried out by our correspondents revealed that there are no less than 3,000 potholes between Abuja and Kano with most of them concentrated between the Kaduna and Abuja stretch.

For instance, between the flyover at the Abuja junction in Kaduna and Olam Farm, our correspondents counted at least 126 potholes of different shapes and sizes.

From Olam ‎to Rijana, there are 114 potholes, 16 of which are very deep. And from Rijana village to Doka village, there are 46 potholes; while from ‎Doka to Katari Junction, there are 159 cracks and holes.

The lane going to Kaduna from Abuja is even worse as there are 170 cracks and holes from Katari to Doka, and 718 potholes from Doka to Rijana.

Our correspondents counted 503 potholes from Rijana to Olam Farm, while from Olam to Kaduna Toll Gate, there are 298 potholes. And from Toll Gate to Gonin Gora, there are 246 holes, giving a total of 1,935 potholes on the two sides of the road within a stretch of 85km.

Motorists plying the routes who were spoken to complained about the effect of the bad road on their lives and the vehicles.

""It is a death trap; the road damages our tyres because if you are not lucky and fall into a big pothole, it will just tear your tyre or force you to veer off the road,"" said a private driver who gave his name simply as Ben.

One of our correspondents saw three broken vehicles that have broken down between Kakau and Katari. ""The problem is not even fixing the vehicle when it has a problem; the road exposes us to security challenges,"" said another motorist, whose front tyre was cut by a deep pothole around Kakau.

Kidnapping, gridlock

Apart from the reported incessant cases of kidnapping by armed bandits over the years, the gridlock has also become the lot of motorists towards Jere and Zuba due to diversions.

The 200km stretch Abuja-Kaduna road has four diversions with the first at the Kaduna-Suleja junction; then at Baban-Tunga by Royal Ceramics. There is another at Iddah and the fourth diversion located at Issah village.

Some motorists who spoke with daily trust expressed frustration over the slow pace of dualisation work on the road, which they said has continued to cause pain to travellers and motorists.

A commercial driver, Aliyu Usman, whose vehicle broke down at Baban-Tunga village, said the deplorable state of the road has continued to inflict hardships on motorists.

Mohammed Ghali, a resident of Tafa town who washes car off the roadside, said no day passed without a vehicle getting involved in an accident along the axis due to potholes.

""Sometimes I mobilise people to fill some of the potholes with sand, yet vehicles do run into the potholes and have tyre burst,"" he said.

Abdullahi Abubakar, a resident of Mararaban Iddah junction, said, ""Just last week, two vehicles were involved in an accident after they ran into potholes... One of the vehicles summersaulted,"" he said.

He said 12 people lost their lives recently after a bus rammed into a pothole, saying some Good Samaritans rushed to the scene and rescued those that sustained injuries.

The Zaria-Kaduna axis of the highway also has its peculiar problem as hundreds of travellers spend hours in gridlocks that often result in accidents, loss of lives, loss of productive hours and damage to goods worth millions of naira.

Investigation by Daily Trust revealed that three parts of the about-70-kilometre road pose serious challenges to motorists.

They are: Kwanar Tsintsiya to Jaji, a segment that is about 35km from Zaria which is described by many road users as ""danger zones"". There is another trouble close to the diversion point at Birnin Yero village, adjacent the Federal Road Safety Corps' (FRSC) office.

The last trouble spot is the stretch between Maraban Jos and Rigachikun, which is about 10km.

Many motorists who spoke with our correspondent lamented what they called ""the snail pace of the reconstruction work.""

Alhaji Zakari Sada, who is one of the motorists that was recently caught in traffic gridlock at the Birnin Yero axis, said he spent about five hours in the gridlock before he eventually struggled his way to his destination.

Another motorist who plies the road almost on daily basis, Malam Mukhtar Musa, called on relevant authorities to ""push the contractors to speed up the work or open up the completed portions.""

The Zaria Unit Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps, Malam Abubakar Murabus Tata, said the command in Birnin Yero is doing its best to ensure free passage of motorists.

Our correspondent observed dangerous potholes on most portions of the Zaria-Kaduna road, especially on the stretches where the road is reduced to single lane.

Kano-Zaria portion a death trap

One of our correspondents who travelled from Kano to Zaria counted two major diversions, several minor diversions and many potholes.

The first major diversion starts from Karfi village in Kura Local Government Area of Kano State as drivers are compelled to use one lane up to Kwanar Dangora in Kiru Local Government Area of the state.

From Kwanar Dangora up to Zaria, drivers use different lanes depending on the portion that suits them.

In Kura town alone, there are three different minor diversions: the first at the entrance of the town from Kano; the second at the middle of the town and the third at the end of the town. There is also another minor diversion at Kadawa village in Garun-Malam Local Government of the state.

Again, shortly after Kura town, Daily Trust observed a place where the road was nearly cut-off by a ditch that always made it difficult for drivers to pass.

A journey from Karfi to Kwanar Dangora that hitherto took drivers 30 to 35 minutes now takes them an hour or more.

The road from Dakatsalle-Gangarida villages up to Kwanar Dangora is terribly bad as drivers have to manoeuvre to avoid potholes.

Malam Ali Sheka, a commercial driver that frequents the Kano-Zaria road, told Daily Trust that they face difficulties plying the road because of the on-going rehabilitation.

""Many drivers and passengers have lost their lives on this road since the commencement of the rehabilitation work,"" he said.

""I suggest that the company handling the work should from time to time open the blocked portions of the road, especially during festivities, including Mondays and Fridays, because of increased number of motorists,"" he said.

Daily Trust recalled that while at the National Assembly to defend President Muhammadu Buhari's recent loan request of $22.718 billion presented to the Senate, the Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, said there was no money to execute a total of 524 on-going road projects across the country.

According to him, ""524 roads projects are currently being executed. N73 billion was released this year; we have contractors willing to do the work but we cannot pay them,"" he said.

""We have had deficit budgets for a long time and so, we have to borrow... (for) over 4 years, we have never received full funding for any budget. There is deficit and we cannot finance it. We must find a way to finance these assets. We will be spending money today to secure tomorrow's assets,"" he said.

Reps angry

Addressing Julius Berger alongside officials of the Ministry of Works and the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), the Chairman of the House Committee on Works, Abubakar Kabir Abubakar (APC, Kano), said the construction company had by its actions and inactions created a situation leading to loss of lives and traffic gridlock on the Abuja-Kano road despite being paid mobilisation of over N50 billion.

He said there are clear indications that Julius Berger will not complete the project within the stipulated 36 months as stated in the contract agreement, insisting that the company does not have the capacity to concurrently handle the various contracts it was awarded across the country.

""We will not shy away from our responsibility in taking hard decisions no matter how difficult or painful the outcome might be,"" he said.

""What is paramount to us right now is the wellbeing and security of Nigerians traveling on these roads and it is our constitutional duty to look out for the best interests of Nigerians,"" he said.

Responding, the representative of Julius Berger PLC, Benjamin Bott, who is the company's Regional Technical Manager, said the company is doing everything possible to complete the work as scheduled.

He regretted the loss of lives and inconveniences caused people using the Abuja-Kano and Lagos-Ibadan highways.

Mr Bott said palliative measures are being put in place to reduce the hardship being experienced by motorists on the road by patching potholes and collaborating with the FRSC to control traffic and reduce accidents.

He disclosed that some sections were not opened to traffic as required because they have not been completed.

The Julius Berger official, however, informed the committee that about 60km of the completed section of the road will be opened for use in the next two months while work on other sections is going on.

But in a statement on Thursday last week, Rep. Abubakar said: ""The committee doubts strongly the capacity of Julius Berger Plc to deliver the remaining 73.3 per cent in the next 18 months.

""Consequently, the committee directed the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing to consider the option of involving other contractors to handle different sections of the road, so as to ensure that the project is delivered in record time."""	https://allafrica.com/stories/201912160015.html
Delayed	"French power group EDF Energy recently announced that plans to start delivering electricity from 2025 from its nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point C, Somerset, may be delayed and the project is over budget by £2.5bn.

This brings the project’s budget to over £21bn in total. EDF cited difficult ground conditions saying the project was at risk of being delayed by 15 months.

Luckily, for UK taxpayers, these costs will be absorbed by the construction firms themselves, but it raises questions about the efficacy of nuclear power in the UK.



Six new nuclear plants are under consideration in the UK, but unlike Hinkley Point C, whose energy prices are locked in, any increases in project costs will directly affect the price consumers pay for energy.

These latest cost increases by EDF make future projects increasingly unlikely to go ahead, as nuclear power projects become less viable compared to alternative energy sources.

Offshore wind energy is now significantly more cost-effective

In September 2019, a raft of new offshore wind projects was announced for the UK. Offshore wind power has become increasingly attractive for the UK as an energy source because of the lack of restrictions on the size of turbines and the UK’s huge wind resources.

Of these new projects, the cheapest operator will provide power for as low as £40 per megawatt-hour, by comparison, Hinkley Point C has a locked-in energy price of £92.50. Offshore wind energy prices have plummeted by up to 30% in the last two years.

Onshore, offshore and solar are now the cheapest energy sources in the UK in terms of their final energy price for consumers, beating nuclear and traditional fossil fuel sources.

Delayed	"EPR nuclear power plant schedules and cost estimates for European sites - Olkiluoto, Flamanville and Hinkley Point - with the benefit of hindsight, look wildly optimistic

Olkiluoto 3 EPR nuclear power plant in Finland (source: TVO)

A number of third generation pressurised water reactor designs – known as EPRs – will soon arrive at nuclear power plants across Europe. But James Varley argues their schedules and cost estimates aren’t necessarily going to plan.

Olkiluoto 3 EPR nuclear power plant

It is extraordinary to think that the initial schedule for the 1600 MWe Olkiluoto 3 pressurised water reactor in Finland – the world’s lead EPR project, so very much a first-of-a-kind undertaking – envisaged a mere four years to get from first concrete (2005) to fuel loading, originally expected in 2009.

Fuel loading is now expected in 2020. According to a schedule provided by the plant vendors (Areva-Siemens consortium) in July 2019 fuel loading was planned for January 2020, grid connection April 2020 and start of regular electricity production was expected in July 2020.

The project is now running about six weeks behind this schedule and the plant owner/operator TVO was expecting to receive in December 2019 an “overall rebaseline schedule for the final phases of the project”, with “final verification of the mechanical, electrical and the I&C systems” needing “to be done carefully and with high quality.”

TVO is also fond of pointing out that “the OL3 plant supplier consortium is constructing the plant under a fixed-price turnkey contract” and that “the supplier consortium companies, Areva GmbH, Areva NP SAS and Siemens AG, have joint and several liability for the contractual obligations until the end of the guarantee period of the plant.”

In the event, the distinction of being the first EPR plant to enter operation went to Taishan in China, where unit 1 entered commercial operation in December 2018 and unit 2 in September 2019.

EDF’s Flamanville 3

In France, EDF is now talking about fuel loading at its 1650 MW Flamanville 3 EPR by the end of 2022, and a construction cost of 12.4 billion (2015) euros.

Construction started in 2007 and the plant was originally scheduled to go commercial in 2013, supposedly benefitting from lessons learned from the first-of-a-kind Olkiluoto 3, and also from EDF taking on the role of its own main contractor, replacing Areva.

Things have not quite turned out as hoped. The latest delay and cost hike has resulted from the need to repair/rework containment penetration welds, considered not compliant with what EDF calls the “break preclusion principle.”

The idea is that these containment penetration welds must achieve a quality “going beyond the nuclear pressure equipment regulations” so that rupture of this piping is so unlikely it can be essentially ruled out, such that “the consequences of rupture of this piping do not need to be completely studied for the plant safety case.”

EDF was asked to repair the eight containment welds by the French nuclear safety regulator (ASN) in a letter of 19 June 2019 and it came up with three possible repair methods, which have been assessed by ASN.

The approach preferred by EDF is the use of robotics to conduct high-precision operations inside the piping concerned.

This technology has been developed for nuclear power plants in operation, says EDF, and can be qualified for the penetration weld rework. The aim is to qualify this repair technique and have it validated by ASN by the end of 2020, at which point EDF would be able to initiate the repair works.

A second repair option, “based on extraction and realignment works in the safeguard auxiliary buildings”, is kept at this stage “as a fall-back solution”, says EDF.

Based on this penetration weld repair strategy, the EDF board of directors approved continuation of Flamanville EPR construction at a meeting held on 8 October 2019.

The provisional schedule for implementation of the preferred, robotic, penetration weld repair scenario, “if the target for validation by the ASN is complied with”, says EDF, results in the fuel loading date slippage to end 2022, and the 1.5 billion euro addition to construction costs.

Hinkley Point C: power for Christmas, but which Christmas?

Meanwhile, at the twin-unit Hinkley Point C EPR in the UK – which former EDF UK CEO Vincent Rivaz once said would be providing the power to cook Christmas dinners in 2017 – the current expectation is that the first unit will generate power at the end of 2025.

The project completion cost is now put at between £21.5bn and £22.5bn, an increase of £1.9bn to 2.9bn compared with the previous estimate, and more than double the original cost estimate of £10bn.

But thankfully, under the terms of the UK’s contract for difference regime, “there is no impact for UK consumers or taxpayers”, while EDF’s project rate of return for Hinkley Point C (IRR) is now estimated to be between 7.6% and 7.8%.

According to EDF, “the cost increases reflect challenging ground conditions which made earthworks more expensive than anticipated, revised action plan targets and extra costs needed to implement the completed functional design, which has been adapted for a first-of-a-kind application in the UK context.”

More positively, Hinkley Point C unit 1 successfully achieved what EDF calls J-0, completion of the nuclear island “common raft”, in June 2019, in line with a schedule announced in September 2016, and the J-0 milestone is expected to be achieved for unit 2 in June 2020."	https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/features/epr-nuclear-power-plant-delays/

PUTRAJAYA: Singapore and Malaysia have formally agreed to postpone the construction of the KL-Singapore High-Speed Rail until end-May 2020, with Malaysia having to pay Singapore S$15 million for costs incurred in suspending the project.

In a joint statement released on Wednesday (Sep 5), both countries said the HSR express service is now expected to start by Jan 1, 2031, instead of the original commencement date of Dec 31, 2026.

The new agreement was signed by Malaysia's Economic Affairs Minister Azmin Ali and Singapore's Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan at the Prime Minister's Office in Putrajaya on Wednesday afternoon.

The signing was witnessed by Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean, his Malaysian counterpart Wan Azizah Wan Ismail and Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.

At a news conference after the signing, Mr Azmin said Malaysia will have to pay Singapore S$15 million in abortive costs before the end of January 2019 for suspending the project.

Additionally, if Malaysia does not proceed with the project by May 31, 2020, it will also bear the agreed costs incurred by Singapore in fulfilling the HSR Bilateral Agreement.

The Singapore Government had spent more than S$250 million on the project by the end of May this year, said Mr Khaw in July. This included costs for consultancies to design the civil infrastructure, costs for dedicating manpower to oversee and deliver the project and costs for land acquisition.



During the suspension period, both countries will ""continue to discuss the best way forward for the HSR project with the aim of reducing costs"", the joint statement said.

""We have all worked tirelessly in order to bring about a resolution that is mutually beneficial,"" said Mr Azmin after the signing ceremony.

""Without doubt, this agreement would not have happened if not for our strong commitment to bilateral cooperation between our two countries,"" he added.

""I am confident that this spirit will see us through the final fruition of the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High-Speed Rail project.""

Mr Khaw also spoke after signing the new agreement.

""Many Singaporeans had been looking forward to the realisation of this project and we remain committed to this project,"" he said, adding that he understood why Malaysia had to suspend the development of the HSR.

The HSR is among several mega projects approved by the previous Malaysian government that have come under review, as the Pakatan Harapan administration relooks the country's finances after winning the May general election.

Dr Mahathir had announced shortly after the election that the HSR project would be scrapped entirely, saying that the rail will not benefit Malaysia.

He later said in July that the project would be deferred instead.

During Wednesday's news conference, Mr Azmin revealed that a flurry of negotiations led to the announcement. The Malaysian Cabinet initially asked for the project to be on hold for three to four years - a message he passed on when visiting Singapore, he said.

Mr Khaw later met him in Kuala Lumpur and told him Singapore was willing to consider postponement of a year. The Malaysian minister returned to Singapore to appeal for it to be suspended for longer.



Both sides agreed that if the deferment was beyond two years, the business model for the project would have changed by then, and ""costs would continue to escalate"". The two countries then mutually agreed on a two-year deferment.

Given the length of suspension, the Singapore and Malaysia companies managing the rail project - SG HSR and MyHSR - will be calling off the ongoing international joint tender for the HSR Assets Company (AssetsCo).

AssetsCo was meant to be responsible for designing, building, financing and maintaining all rolling stock as well as rail assets such as power, signalling and telecommunications.

The proposed 350km-long HSR line aims to reduce travel time between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur to around 90 minutes by train, from the current 11 hours on existing train services.

When operational, the line will offer an express service between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore, a domestic service from Kuala Lumpur to Iskandar Puteri and a shuttle service from Iskandar Puteri to Jurong East."	https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/high-speed-rail-postponed-malaysia-singapore-agreement-10686032
Delayed	"Teollisuuden Voima Oyj (TVO), owner of the Olkiluoto 3 EPR (European Pressurized Water Reactor) nuclear unit that is under construction in Finland, has said fuel will not be loaded in the reactor before the end of August, while it awaits completion of a schedule review being conducted by the construction consortium. Meanwhile, EDF, which is building an EPR at its Flamanville site in France, was informed by the French nuclear safety regulator, Autorité de Sûreté Nucléaire (ASN), that eight welds in the main steam transfer pipes that penetrate the two walls of the containment must be repaired before the reactor is commissioned.

Setbacks have plagued the two under-construction units. Olkiluoto 3 was ordered as a turnkey delivery from a consortium formed by AREVA GmbH, AREVA NP SAS, and Siemens AG. The plant was originally expected to commence commercial operation at the end of April 2009. However, according to the latest schedule update by the plant supplier, regular production was planned to begin in January 2020. Now, it appears that timeline won’t be met.

In April, TVO said that work during the first quarter of the year at Olkiluoto 3 had not progressed according to the updated schedule issued by the plant supplier in November 2018. Last week, it said a new schedule review would be completed in July rather than as expected in June.

TVO announced some good news in May, however. It said vibration detected in the cooling circuit’s pressurizer surge line during hot functional testing in the first half of 2018 would be eliminated using “liquid absorbers.” The company reported that the bitumen material used in the absorbers had been approved by the Finnish Radiation and Nuclear Authority (STUK). Other positive developments in roughly the past year include completion of hot functional testing in May 2018, STUK granting licenses to operating personnel in December 2018, and the Finnish government granting an operating license for the EPR in March 2019.

At the Flamanville site—where work began in December 2007 and the unit was originally expected to start commercial operation in 2013—weld quality deviations have been the most-recent problem. On Dec. 3, 2018, EDF submitted to ASN a technical file presenting the procedures for repairing and upgrading the main secondary circuit welds, which had showed deficiencies with respect to break preclusion requirements. The company also submitted the specific justification method for the eight welds located in the reactor containment building structure.

Earlier this month, EDF reportedly asked ASN about the possibility of repairing the welds in 2024, after the unit was commissioned. While ASN said that would be technically feasible, it would pose a number of problems, notably with regard to demonstrating the safety of the reactor during the interim period.

In a statement, EDF said it “is currently analysing the impact of this decision on the Flamanville EPR schedule and cost, and, in the upcoming weeks, it will give a detailed update on the next steps in the project.”

Delayed	"* ASN rules weldings must be fixed before reactor startup

* EDF had hoped to fix weldings in 2024, after startup

* Flamanville debacle weighs on future of French nuclear (Adds ASN, EDF, Greenpeace comments)

By Bate Felix and Geert De Clercq

PARIS, June 20 (Reuters) - EDF faces new cost overruns and delays of up to three years at the nuclear reactor it is building in Flamanville in northern France after the French regulator ordered repairs.

ASN, the French nuclear watchdog, said on Thursday that state-owned EDF would have to repair eight faulty weldings in the reactor’s containment building, adding that it had rejected a request to delay repairs until 2024, after its startup.

“Delaying the repairs until after startup would raise issues about reactor safety during the transition period,” ASN said.

In a similar procedure two years ago, ASN ruled that Flamanville would be allowed to start up despite weak spots in the steel of its reactor vessel cover, but ordered it to replace the reactor cover by 2024 at the latest. bit.ly/2Y2hbUr

EDF said in a statement it is analysing the impact of the ASN ruling on the Flamanville startup schedule and costs and that it will give a detailed update in the coming weeks.

ASN director Bernard Doroszczuk told reporters that EDF had estimated it could repair the weldings by the end of 2022.

This means the Flamanville startup would again be delayed by two or three years from the most recent startup target of loading fuel in the reactor by the end of this year.

Problems with the weldings were first reported early last year and in July EDF said that a total of 53 weldings on the reactor’s secondary circuit would have to be redone, while it was confident it could convince ASN that 10 others were fit for service.

The state-owned utility delayed the reactor startup by a year and targeted the loading of fuel in the reactors during the fourth quarter of 2019, with commercial operation by mid-2020.

When construction of Flamanville started in 2007, the original target launch date was 2012.

In July 2018 EDF also said the welding problems would add an extra 400 million euros in costs, pushing the total cost of the project up to 10.9 billion euros, compared to an initial estimate of 3 billion euros.

Greenpeace France said in a statement the repairs would push the cost up by another two billion euros at least.

“EDF has been in denial about this since 2013, first denying there was a problem, then refusing to fix it, then by wanting to fix it after startup. It is a scandalous attitude towards nuclear safety,” Greenpeace France’s chief nuclear campaigner Yannick Rousselet said.

EDF wants to build new reactors as its current fleet of 58 reactors is ageing and Flamanville’s problems are weighing heavily on the future of the nuclear industry in France.

French President Emmanuel Macron has asked EDF to draw up a plan for building new reactors, with a view to making a decision about nuclear newbuild in 2021, but that plan hinges on the EPR reactor model in Flamanville being operational.

Problems with Flamanville and another EPR under construction in Finland are also weighing on EDF’s ability to sell reactors abroad.

Delayed	"Construction of the important East-West highway in Nigeria now looks to face serious delays. Work to a key section of the highway route in Delta State has been affected by a shortage of funds, with over US$215 million need to complete its construction. This section of the East-West highway is of particular national importance as it provides an upgraded connection to Nigeria’s oil producing region, which provides much of the country’s GDP.

The Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) is seeking out private investment for this section of the highway. Given the strong presence of international oil firms in the region, the potential for overseas finance should be strong. A significant percentage of the existing road network in the region is in a very poor state and in the rainy season, journeys can be torturous as a result. The Eleme-Refinery junction stretch of the route has been identified as requiring immediate repairs. The problems with the East-West Highway form part of a larger problem for this region of Nigeria however.



Although South East Nigeria is home to the country’s oil industry on which the country relies economically, the infrastructure in the region has suffered from a serious lack of investment over many years.

Delayed	"The Flamanville nuclear power plant is considered a litmus test for the next generation of EPR technology

EDF is building the Flamanville nuclear power plant in north-west France (Credit: EDF)

French energy supplier EDF has revealed that its long-awaited new reactor at Flamanville nuclear power plant will cost €1.5bn ($1.6bn) more than its previous forecast.

EDF has also confirmed that delays to the date when the plant, in the north-west of France, will begin operations is due to welding repair work.

Initially, the European pressurised reactor (EPR) in Flamanville was projected to cost €3.3bn ($3.6bn) and due to come on stream in 2012.

But EDF has now admitted in a revised plan for the project that it does not expect to load fuel at the plant until 2022, a decade on from the original deadline.

An EDF statement on Wednesday (9 October) said that the cost will now rise to €12.4bn ($13.6bn).

EDF’s welding issues with Flamanville nuclear power plant project

EDF, of which the French government owns 83.7%, first noted in early 2018 that it was experiencing welding problems at the Flamanville site.

In July last year, the energy group confirmed it had already added €400m ($439m) to the budget.

Twelve months later, EDF confirmed the Flamanville scheme would be delayed until at least 2022 due to faulty weldings.

This came after the the French Nuclear Safety Authority (ASN) admitted concerns for the plant and said EDF was required to repair eight of the joins at the nuclear plant.

EDF said it attempted to convince ASN that eight hard-to-reach weldings in the building where the reactor is situated were fit for service, but the watchdog’s ruled the weldings would have to be re-done.

What is the Flamanville nuclear power plant project?

The Flamanville nuclear power plant project is considered a litmus test for the next generation of EPR technology under construction at the site.

There is currently one EPR operating in China, although EDF is under increased pressure to get everything right in the French scheme because it holds sole ownership and ASN approval would ensure extra credibility for the technology.

Two further EPR projects are underway in Europe – the Olkiluoto project in Finland, which is over a decade late in its construction, and the UK’s Hinkley Point C.

The project at Hinkley Point C has not been short in controversy, after EDF said last month it is now likely to cost between £21.5bn ($26.6bn) and £22.5bn ($27.9bn) – an increase of £1.9bn ($2.4bn) to £2.9bn ($3.59bn) compared with previous estimates.

The French firm updated the flagship project’s cost following the completion of the J-0 reactor base in June and has also confirmed unspecified increases to the delays at unit one and unit two, which were originally placed at 15 months and nine months respectively.

It has promised the additional costs will be applied to the company and not British taxpayers, while the next major milestone for Hinkley Point C, based in Somerset, south-west England, will be the completion of the common raft for unit two in June 2020."	https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/news/flamanville-nuclear-power-plant-costs/
Delayed	"French energy giant EDF has confirmed its flagship nuclear power project in France will be further delayed by at least three years.

The company, which is building the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in the UK, said the launch of its nuclear reactor at Flamanville in Normandy has been pushed back due to problems with weldings.

The Flamanville reactor was initially due to be operational by 2012, showcasing a European Pressurised Reactor, but has had repeated setbacks over the years.

EDF is now reviewing the decision from the French Nuclear Safety Authority (ASN), which ordered the company to repair eight faulty welds at the plant.

The energy giant, therefore, said commissioning of the nuclear plant cannot be expected before the end of 2022.

EDF Chief Executive Jean-Bernard Levy has been quoted as saying: “The time that we will need to prepare the repairs, carry out the repairs and get everything checked by the ASN and then have the whole plant tested again and prepared to be launched… that will lead to delays of more than three years.

“So we don’t think it’s possible to commission it before the end of 2022.”"	https://www.energylivenews.com/2019/07/29/edf-confirms-further-delay-at-flamanville-nuclear-plant/
Delayed	"French energy giant EDF has suffered another blow in the development of its controversial Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant in the U.K. after costs soared by as much as £2.9 billion ($3.6 billion), potentially rising to a total of more than £22 billion.

EDF said “challenging ground conditions” have made earthworks at the site more expensive than expected. A set of remedies are now underway with contractors, and depending on their success, costs will rise by between £1.9 billion to £2.9 billion. That means another 0.3 percent being stripped from the internal rate of return (IRR).

The two reactors under construction, which will total 3.2 gigawatts of generating capacity, are delayed nine and 15 months, respectively. First power is now expected in 2025.

Hinkley Point C has a 35-year contract for difference (CFD) with the U.K. government guaranteeing it £92.50 per megawatt-hour ($115). A review of that 2012 deal by the national spending watchdog called it “high-cost and risky.”

Last week’s CFD auction for renewable generation saw offshore wind prices drop to £39.65 per megawatt-hour.

The structure of the CFD means consumers aren’t exposed to increased costs beyond the strike price.

Jonathan Cobb, senior communication manager at the World Nuclear Association, pointed out that at the time of Hinkley CFD award in 2012, the price was comparable with those being awarded to other technologies, including offshore wind.

“Progress with offshore wind is welcome, but it is an intermittent supply,"" Cobb said. ""Relying on gas to fill the gaps will not be possible if the U.K. is to achieve full decarbonization of its electricity generation mix.""

""To provide supplies of electricity that are both clean and reliable the UK will need a broader range of low-carbon generation technologies, including a substantial contribution from nuclear,” Cobb said.

Unhappy returns

A series of delays at Hinkey Point C have seen EDF’s internal rate of return slide away, a familiar story for a number of nuclear projects attempted or planned in Europe and the U.S. in recent years.

In 2015, a budget forecast handed over to EU officials put the IRR at 11.4 percent. That has fallen steadily, and today's announcement puts the IRR at 7.6 to 7.8 percent.

In January, Hitachi hit the pause button on its own new-build nuclear plans in the U.K., citing financing issues. In November 2018, Toshiba scrapped its own plans to develop new nuclear capacity in the U.K. after failing to attract new partners to take a share in the venture.

The lone nuclear plant being built in the U.S., Georgia Power's Vogtle, is years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget.

Despite the surface-level gulf in CFD prices between Hinkley Point C and renewables, the U.K. government has stuck by its plans to pave the way for new nuclear capacity. Since reaffirming that position in 2017, the government has set a net-zero-carbon climate target for 2050, with big implications for the electrification of the economy.

While the government wants to decarbonize as quickly and as economically as possible, its partial moratorium on onshore wind, lack of support for utility-scale solar and apparent blind spot when it comes to the potential of energy storage have undermined its efforts.

Seven of the U.K.'s eight existing nuclear power stations are set to go offline in the next 10 years. EDF hopes to follow up the Hinkley Point C development with another new site. If that follow-on project, Sizewell C, is ultimately built, Hinkley's strike price would drop to £89.50 per megawatt-hour, a sort of bulk-buy deal for the taxpayer.

EDF says Sizewell C would benefit from being a “near replica” of Hinkley C.

The U.K. government has opened a consultation to explore alternative ways to fund new nuclear. The proposal under investigation guarantees a return for the developer and raises revenue through bills.

That shifts the development risks to consumers, but, as all the finance doesn’t need to be in place from day one, it should theoretically draw in a larger pool of potential investors.

Delayed	The Senate Standing Committee on Planning on Friday expressed its ire over non submission of reports by the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) and Federal Ministry of Planning on Nai Gaj Dam, a hydro power project whose cost has escalated due to delay in completion.The committee chairman, Senator Agha Shahzaib Durrani, said the panel had instructed Wapda and the ministry to submit reports of their monitoring teams but despite passage of eight months the reports had not been provided.Earlier, the committee was told that design of the dam had issues and the project was undertaken without proper planning. The 4.2 megawatt hydro power project being built on Gaj River near Dadu district of Sindh was started in 2012 and was supposed to complete in 3 years.However, in 2015 the project cost (PC-1) was revised. In 2018 the PC-1 was revised again. No work has been carried out at the project since 2018, the committee was told.They said the cost of the revised PC-I of the project had reached Rs47 billion, an Rs20 billion increase from the approved Rs26 billion in PC-I in 2012. Speaking on the occasion, a member of the committee, Rukhsana Zuberi said people who handled the project negligently should be held accountable.Thy said the Sindh government was not abiding by the decision of the Executive Committee of National Economic Council (Ecnec) and the cost of the dam was increasing with each passing day. The project’s initial cost was Rs26 billion.Objecting to Ecnec’s decision, Sindh had earlier told the apex court that the provincial government could not pay 50% cost of the project. However, the Sindh government had agreed to Wapda proposal on the construction of dam.Nai Gaj is a torrent which starts from Khuzdar, Balochistan and after passing through the plains of Kutch enters Manchar Lake. The Nai Gaj banks remain dry for eight months and receive water in four months during the monsoon season.After Manchar Lake reaches its peak level, water from Nai Gaj often devastates embankments and floods fields.After inundating farms and destroying houses and crops, the water goes into the sea.Besides providing continuous flow of fresh water to Manchar Lake, the Nai Gaj dam will also improve socio-economic conditions of the residents of Dadu.	https://tribune.com.pk/story/2100452/1-nai-gaj-dam-undertaken-without-due-planning

Just over a year ago, in August 2018, Crossrail Ltd announced that the central section of the new east-west line from Paddington to Abbey Wood would not open in December 2018, as planned.

Sadiq Khan, London’s mayor and chair of Transport for London (TfL), said he was “deeply angry and frustrated” when he learned of the delay to the project, which has been beset by problems since it began in 2009 and whose budget has ballooned to £17.6bn from the £15.4bn agreed at the outset.

Then, in April of this year, more controversy. Following a board meeting to review how the troubled project was progressing, Crossrail Ltd revealed that it now planned to open the central section of the Elizabeth line – named in honour of the Queen – sometime between October 2020 and March 2021.

The company said “bugs” in software for trains and signalling systems could delay Europe’s largest infrastructure project still further and that London’s new railway – which will run beneath the capital from Reading and Heathrow in the west, through central tunnels to Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the east, increasing central London rail capacity by 10% – may not open until the end of 2021.

“The train software needs to be given a chance to mature,” Crossrail Ltd CEO Mark Wild told the Financial Times. “There are bugs on the Siemens system we are running and we need to get them out. We need to whizz around the track hundreds of times to do that.”



Testing times: ECTS, TPWS and CBTC signalling systems

Unfortunately, delays in completing train and signalling software mean there are only four class 345 trains being tested on Crossrail’s central section. The issue is that the 70-strong fleet of 200m-long Bombardier trains ordered by TfL have to be integrated with three different signalling systems.

The section of the Elizabeth line between Paddington and Heathrow uses the European Train Control System (ECTS), the core signalling and train control component of ERTMS, the European Rail Traffic Management System. ETCS continuously calculates a safe maximum speed for each train, with cab signalling for the driver and on-board systems that take control if the permissible speed is exceeded.

“Crossrail is now in its critical and most challenging final phase due to the significant integration and testing work that remains to be completed.”

West of Heathrow and east of Stratford, the trains use an automatic warning system, combined with a train protection and warning system (TPWS). A standard TPWS consists of an on-track transmitter adjacent to a signal – any train that passes it will automatically have its emergency brake activated.

Finally, the central section uses Siemens’ proprietary communications-based train control (CBTC) system, which makes use of the telecommunications between the train and track equipment in order to manage rail traffic and control infrastructure.

Creating interfaces that allow the Bombardier trains to switch from the legacy signalling systems to the newer ones is key to getting the testing back on track and timely delivery of the Elizabeth line.

“Trains are more software than hardware these days,” transport expert and author Christian Wolmar told Wired. “The hardware is pretty simple but the software is the real issue. Debugging the software is a massive task.”

United front: companies collaborate to fix software bugs

To address the issue, Crossrail has established a joint team comprising senior technical experts from Bombardier, Siemens and Crossrail to coordinate the testing of both vehicles and signalling systems.

The Dynamic Testing phase in order to assess the technical railway systems involves software testing on four different trains. Vehicles have been operating at line speed (100km/h/62mph) in the central section using the new automatic signalling system. Close headway testing – where trains are run close together – began on 8 June having been delayed due to an unspecified “safety critical failure”.

“The 70 Bombardier trains, each 200m in length, have to be integrated with three different signalling systems.”

The train and signalling software is being tested off-site and in the tunnel environment. The off-site simulation is being undertaken by Siemens and Bombardier at the Crossrail Integration Facility (CIF) in Chippenham in Wiltshire and by Bombardier in Derby. Each new version of the train and signalling software increases both the functionality and the range of Dynamic Testing that can be undertaken.

“Fit-out is nearing completion at many stations and testing of the train and signalling system is underway but there is still a huge amount to do before the central section can open,” said Crossrail Ltd CEO Mark Wild in August. “Crossrail is now in its critical and most challenging final phase due to the significant integration and testing work that remains to be completed.

“We are fully focused on completing the Elizabeth line and ensuring a safe and reliable passenger service as quickly as possible.”

Forward momentum: software configurations and Crossrail targets

Crossrail is using a signalling software configuration called P_D+8. Testing with a later Siemens configuration (P_D+10) was due to start in October, and was expected to enable progress to the intensive Trial Running phase simulating the full railway timetable on 24 trains per hour – the number of trains that will run at peak times each hour between Paddington and Whitechapel – in the first quarter of 2020.

“If another version of the software configuration is required, the ‘opening window would be under increased risk’.”

However, according to TFL Programme & Investment Committee report from 23 October, testing in the CIF has “identified some missing functionality and some defects”. The next version (PD+11) will be used for the start of Trial Running. PD+10 will still be installed in the central section in early October and reliability and functional testing will continue while the next version is developed.

P+11 is planned to be delivered for testing on the central section of the route in early December. CRL reports that the use of PD+11 should not delay the start of Trial Running planned in the first quarter of 2020, though if another version of the software configuration is required (i.e. to PD+12), the “opening window would be under increased risk”. The nature of the software development means uncertainty will remain until each version is tested.

“Siemens and Bombardier collaboration remains strong, with senior resources collocated in Westferry Circus and with the right level of CEO engagement, including recent meetings in Germany with senior officials from Crossrail, Siemens and Bombardier,” Crossrail Ltd told Railway Technology in a statement. “This has been a major achievement for the programme and will ultimately de-risk the development and assurance process.”"	https://www.railway-technology.com/features/crossrail-delay/

Germany’s Berlin Brandenburg Airport has stated that it will open on 31 October 2020, nine years after the initial target date.

Airport CEO Engelbert Lütke Daldrup announced the opening date to the Supervisory Board.

Airport construction commenced in 2006 with an initial budget of €2.83bn. The total cost of the project has now increased to €7bn.

Berlin Brandenburg Airport was expected to replace the Tegel and Schönefeld airports, which were deemed inadequate for the city’s future projected air traffic.

Its opening was postponed due to various issues such as technical problems, planning errors and controversies.



The airport construction was delayed as the construction planning company declared bankruptcy in 2010.

In 2012, it was discovered that the airport’s fire protection and alarm system had issues, which have been prevalent to date.

In 2013, the European Union (EU) started an investigation into whether Germany violated EU environmental-protection laws for the airport’s flight routes.

Increased air traffic to the two other airports in 2014 forecasted that Berlin Brandenburg Airport would operate at full capacity on opening. Due to this, the airport needed to undergo redesigns before opening.

In 2015, an investigation was launched regarding alleged fraud by Siemens, Bosch and Deutsche Telekom unit T-Systems about their work at the airport.

In addition, the airport manager was jailed for taking a bribe from the fire protection system company, Imtech. Safety-testing firm TÜV discovered 800 wiring breaches at the airport site.

Tegel Airport is expected to be closed around a week after the opening of Berlin Brandenburg Airport."	https://www.airport-technology.com/news/berlin-brandenburg-airport-open-october-2020/
Delayed	"Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) has blamed Ministry for Planning, Development and Reforms for causing delay and subsequent cost escalation in Nai Gaj dam project. Senior WADPA officials while briefing the Senate Standing Committee on Planning, Development and Reforms, which held here on Friday under the chairmanship of Senator Shahzeb Durrani, said that Nai Gaj dam project was hit by different controversies from initial stages.

They said that the construction cost in beginning was estimated at Rs 59 billion and the plan was sent to the Ministry of Planning, Development and Reforms for approval which reduced the construction cost to Rs 26 billion but over the years out of Rs 26 billion allocation, the commission has released only Rs 5 billion for the project.

The Senate standing committee discussed the current status of the Nai Gaj dam in Dadu, Sindh, the provincial wise distribution of HEC scholarships and delay in the construction of family suits of Parliament Lodges. The committee also discussed the implementation status of its previous recommendation for supplying clean water to Gwadar and PSDP allocations in this regard. The committee was informed that work on Nai Gaj dam was started in September 2009 but was delayed due to changes in its design and financial problems.

The WAPDA official informed the meeting the contract was awarded in 2013 and the project was supposed to be completed in three years. In 2015 the PC-I of the project was revised but the work was not started. The meeting was told that in 2018 once again the PC-1 was revised.

The committee was informed that WAPDA included additional components such as a power house, project colony, access roads, cost of spillways and pipeline to the Manchar Lake, increasing the cost of completion of the dam to Rs 46.73 billion.

Official of the Planning Ministry informed that work has been stopped on the project since 2018. The PC-1 will be submitted for approval by the Executive Committee of National Economic Council (ECNEC). It was further informed that out of 7,507 acres of land for the project, the government of Sindh has given only 303 acres of land. Sindh is also not ready to pay its 50 percent share of the project. The chairman committee asked him to stop talking and find a solution for the problems.

Senator Rukhsana Zubairi said that action should be taken against those who have caused delay in the project. Senator Rana Maqbool Ahmad said when funds are not available, new projects should not be started.

Agha Shahzeb Durrani showed his displeasure over delay in providing the monitoring report of the project. He said that eight months ago the committee had issued clear instruction that Planning Ministry and WAPDA should dispatch their monitoring teams to the Nai Gaj and provide report to the committee. However the directives were not implemented, he added.

The matter of 300 scholarships in 50 different sectors was also discussed and the chairman of the committee said that no progress was made on the issue. He said that the committee had recommended these scholarships for women to make them more powerful. The officials of the HEC said that they will provide detailed report in this regard in the upcoming meeting.

The committee was also briefed about the revised renewable energy policy 2019 and it was informed that it will be presented during the next cabinet meeting.

On the issue of clean drinking water to Gwadar, the committee was informed the project was underway and 45 percent work has been completed. The committee was informed that the Planning Commission has not released any funds during the first quarter of 2019.

The committee was informed that during the last 17 years, a total of 243,731 scholarships have been granted to Master, MPhil and PhD students."	https://www.brecorder.com/2019/11/16/544878/nai-gaj-dam-project-wapda-blames-mopdr-for-delay-cost-escalation/
Delayed	"ISLAMABAD: A parliamentary body on Tuesday objected to delays in the completion of the Nai Gaj dam, the construction cost of which has escalated from Rs17 billion to Rs47.7bn in the last decade.

The Senate Standing Committee on Planning, Development and Reform was informed that the project, which started in September 2009, had been delayed due to changes in its design and financial problems.

“The matter has become quite complex in the face of the new water policy. The matter is sub judice and the best solution is to wait for the Supreme Court decision on the matter,” Planning, Development and Reform Secretary Zafar Hasan told the committee that had met to discuss the current status of the Nai Gaj dam in Dadu city, Sindh.

The senior official explained that there was a stalemate between the federal and Sindh governments over who would pay the difference between the original cost of Rs16.9bn in 2009 and the Rs26.23bn cost in PC-1, which was revised in 2012.

Federal govt blames Sindh govt for financial delays while Sindh claims project revised on account of deferred payments

The official explained that it was the understanding of the federal government that financial delays were on the part of the Sindh government.

The meeting was told that in the revised PC-1 2018, the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) included additional components such as a power house, project colony, access roads, cost of spillways and pipeline to the Manchhar Lake, increasing the cost of completion of the dam to Rs46.73bn. It has been nine months since the second PC-1 was submitted for approval by the Executive Committee of National Economic Council (Ecnec).

“Encec has decided that the federal and Sindh governments share the escalated costs equally. However, the Sindh government insists that the federal government should bear the increased costs entirely,” Mr Hasan told the committee.

In his response, Sindh Irrigation Special Secretary Aslam Ansari informed the members that the government of Sindh was prepared to contribute its share for land acquisition and resettlement that amounted to about Rs1.8bn.

“However, the Nai Gaj project has been revised on account of deferred payments after which completion cost increased and secondly due to changes in design. The Sindh government has no stake, influence or interference in either of these items. The deferred payments should have been streamlined by the federal government after approval of PC-1. It is, therefore, unjustified to ask the Sindh government to pay the escalated costs,” Mr Ansari argued.

He said that the stance of the Sindh government had been submitted to the Supreme Court, which has taken notice of the issue. He reiterated that the Sindh government was ready to contribute its share for land acquisition and security.

Committee chairman Agha Shahzaib Durrani reminded the planning secretary of the directive issued six months ago to initiate an investigation against those responsible for the delay in the Nai Gaj project.

“The committee also reminded the ministry on July 30 of an inquiry report but did not receive a reply. We direct the Ministry of Planning and Development to share the report within a week,” Mr Durrani said.

Billed as Europe's most ambitious infrastructure project, the line was supposed to open in December 2018, but has been repeatedly delayed by problems with safety testing and the completion of signalling work.

Transport for London said on Friday it had now been notified that the line would not open until 2021. The budget is running at 15.4 billion pounds ($19.7bn) but could be between 400 million pounds ($512m) and 650 million pounds ($832.5m) higher than that.

The transport department said the route, named the Elizabeth Line, would open as soon as practically possible in 2021. It is in discussions with Crossrail about how to fund the additional costs.

It also expressed its annoyance over the repeated changes in the designs of the project that seemed to be the major cause of delay in project completion and escalation of cost.

The committee, which met with Senator Agha Shahzaib Durrani in the chair, also directed the Ministry of Planning Development and Reforms to conduct an inquiry into the matter and submit a detailed report of the causes that led to delay and rise in the cost of the project before the committee within a week’s time.

The chairman stressed the need for setting priority projects looking into resource availability before initiating developmental projects and also asked for setting up a proper pattern for financing these projects.

Meanwhile, Secretary Ministry of Planning Development and Reforms Zafar Hassan informed the meeting that demands for development projects from the provinces was increasing, adding that forward liabilities were also huge.

He said that lack of resources enhanced the project cost and also caused delay in completion. However, he said that the government was formulating policies to ensure completion of all social sector developmental projects with-in the stipulated time-frame to avoid delay in price escalation.

The senior officials of the Higher Education Commission (HEC) informed the committee that HEC had awarded 14,175 scholarships under its ongoing programs for financial year 2019-20.

Delayed	"LAGOS (Reuters) - Plans to build another privately-financed power station in Nigeria to help end decades of chronic blackouts have been delayed because of concerns about persistent shortfalls in payments for electricity across the sector.

High-tension electrical power lines are seen at the Azura-Edo Independent Power Plant (IPP) on the outskirt of Benin City in Edo state, Nigeria June 13, 2018. Picture taken June 13, 2018. REUTERS/Akintunde Akinleye

The $1.1 billion Qua Iboe Power Plant being developed by energy infrastructure company Black Rhino and the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation won’t get a green light by the end of 2018 as planned and it was unclear when the deal might close, NNPC told Reuters.

The delay is a setback for Africa’s biggest oil producer where 80 million people don’t have access to grid power supplies and it exposes the difficulties in attracting private investment to a sector that successive governments have tried to reform.

The uncertainty surrounding the 540-megawatt Qua Iboe plant stems from the difficulties Nigeria’s first privately-financed independent power project - the 460-megawatt Azura-Edo plant - has encountered since it came online this year.

Azura was meant to be a model for a string of independent power plants financed by international investors. To give them confidence to invest in the first major plant since the power sector was privatized in 2013, the World Bank provided a safeguard known as a partial risk guarantee - meaning the lender would step in if Nigeria defaulted on payments.

Under the current system, the government-owned Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading company (NBET) buys power from generators and passes it on to distributors who then collect money from customers and reimburse NBET.

But because NBET is not paid in full for the power it buys, generators such as Azura have been partly reimbursed from an emergency central bank loan fund created to keep the sector afloat.

NNPC told Reuters one of the reasons the Qua Iboe plant (QIPP), which is due to be built in the southern state of Akwa Ibom, had been delayed was because NBET appeared reluctant to commit to new projects to avoid increasing its liabilities.

“The continued delay relates to the current cashflow challenges at NBET, as highlighted by the Azura project,” a spokesman for NNPC said in an emailed statement. “This concern is justified by the fact that NBET is yet to see an improvement in collections from DISCOs (distribution companies).”

NBET did not immediately respond to a request for comment on NNPC’s statement about QIPP.

NBET chief executive Marilyn Amobi told Reuters in November that it was hard for the company to work because of poor infrastructure and shortfalls in cash from distributors needed to reimburse generators.

“You don’t have the infrastructure, you don’t have the financial position to do it, you don’t actually have the products, and you don’t have the grid,” she said.

WORLD BANK CONDITIONS

NNPC said another problem for QIPP was that the World Bank had made a partial risk guarantee, similar to the one that helped Azura attract investors, contingent on the government’s implementation of an agreed power sector recovery plan.

“In theory it is okay, but the risk is there are delays in the approvals which may impact QIPP,” NNPC said.

Power ministry officials and the World Bank have been in talks about long-term structural changes needed to trigger the release of a $1 billion loan to help pay for reforms.

A World Bank spokeswoman said the loan had yet to be submitted to its board for approval and that the Washington-based lender considered the recovery plan to be “critical for de-risking the sector for private investments”.

Problems that need to be tackled include decaying infrastructure, mounting debts, low tariffs for electricity and a dilapidated government-owned grid that would collapse if all the country’s power generators operated at full tilt.

Even though NBET has an agreement to buy 13 gigawatts (GW) from power generators, the system can only cope with distributors sending out an average of 4 GW, according to the ministry of power.

The World Bank spokeswoman confirmed any future guarantees for independent power plants (IPPs) would be linked to the plan’s implementation - because the economic and financial viability of generation capacity expansion was at risk.

A spokeswoman for Black Rhino, which is one of private equity firm Blackstone’s portfolio companies, declined to comment on NNPC’s announcement of a delay to QIPP.

When the project was unveiled, Nigerian cement giant Dangote Group was named as a joint venture partner - along with Black Rhino and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation.

But a Dangote executive told Reuters on condition of anonymity that the company, owned by Africa’s richest man, Aliko Dangote, had pulled out.

“The huge debt level, and, the fact the IPPs are not making profits, is another reason for prospective investors to be deterred,” he said. “Further, collecting revenue from the distribution companies is also becoming a mirage.”

A Dangote Group spokesman declined to comment on the delay to QIPP, or whether the company had pulled out.

‘ILLIQUID AND INSOLVENT’

The payment problems in the Nigerian power sector were thrust into the spotlight in March when four generating companies filed a lawsuit against the government and Azura.

To ensure the generating companies were paid in full throughout 2017 and 2018, the government created a 701 billion naira ($2.3 billion) loan fund at the central bank to guarantee payments. When the fund was established in 2017, Azura wasn’t part of the calculations.

But when Azura started producing electricity, the fund was also used to pay the new plant to ensure the terms of loan deals guaranteed by the World Bank were not breached. As a result, the other companies were told they would only receive 80 percent of the sums owed, according to the lawsuit filed in March.

The four energy companies want the fund to reimburse them in full, rather than allocating part of the money to the new plant.

Azura declined to comment on payments for power generated.

“If the central bank wasn’t paying, the system would collapse,” an official at a multilateral lender said on condition of anonymity. “Qua Iboe IPP would enter a system that is illiquid and insolvent. The liquidity is being provided by the central bank.”

The official said QIPP would need the same partial risk guarantee Azura received to get off the ground, but the handling of payments to Azura by the Nigerian authorities so far meant there was little appetite to offer the same support.

Fola Fagbule, senior vice president and head of advisory at Africa Finance Corporation (AFC) - one of the multilateral lenders that invested in Azura - agreed that the Qua Iboe project would struggle without payment guarantees.

“What you have is an insolvent system,” he said. “It is really difficult to make a case for a project on that scale.”

A person with direct knowledge of QIPP who declined to be named said Azura’s experience was damaging international investors’ view of Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation.

“There has to be some understanding of how the sector is going to be able to afford new electrons coming into the grid,” the person said. “(Those involved) do not want QIPP to build a project that could just end up in a default situation.”

‘KNOTTY ISSUES’

Nigeria’s privatized power sector typically does not use meters to provide invoices, bill collections are low and energy tariffs have remained fixed for three years, meaning customers receive unsustainably cheap electricity.

The effect, say industry experts, is that electricity distribution companies recover so little revenue from customers that they pay less than a third of what they owe to generating companies - and that’s why debts have ballooned.

Sunday Oduntan, spokesman for the Association of Nigerian Electricity Distributors, said debt levels in the sector were caused by the artificial suppression of tariffs. He said there was a 1.3 trillion naira ($4.2 billion) market shortfall that meant distributors were unable to invest in improvements.

“You cannot be selling a product below cost price and expect high remittance. The shortfall in the sector is because of the lack of a cost-reflective tariff,” said Oduntan, who speaks on behalf of Nigeria’s 11 electricity distribution companies.

Debts across the sector partly stem from a currency crisis that took hold in 2016, just months after Azura secured its financing. The bulk of power company costs are in U.S. dollars but customers pay for power in naira.

The naira lost about 30 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar in June 2016 but the devaluation was not factored into a government tariff structure that has remained unchanged.

Louis Edozien, permanent secretary in the ministry of power, told Reuters there was evidence tariffs must rise, but it was also the responsibility of distributors to improve their collections, partly through better metering and infrastructure.

As for the future of QIPP, the state oil company said it would take six to eight months from whenever NBET executes an agreement to purchase power from the plant before a final investment decision could be taken.

The NNPC spokesman said there were a number of other “knotty issues”, including the completion of a transmission line from the project site. He said QIPP had now agreed in a major concession to pay $20 million for it to be finished.

He also said there was a disagreement between QIPP and the central bank about the exchange rate at which power producers could buy U.S. dollars with naira. He said this had been escalated to the minister of finance.

With the $1 billion World Bank power sector loan on hold for now, the government is considering putting another 600 billion naira into the central bank fund to pay generators when the initial amount runs out early next year, sources said.

It was not clear how the central bank loans to the sector would be repaid.

Central Bank Governor Godwin Emefiele told Reuters that payments from the fund could be made up to February and that the bank was holding talks with World Bank officials.

“The loan negotiations are still in progress with no terminal date yet fixed,” the power ministry’s Edozien said.

Delayed	"Possible defects in electro-mechanical work carried out by a now-disgraced state-owned company in Ethiopia will add four more years to the construction schedule of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), a project official said yesterday.

A senior minister rued as a “grave mistake” the appointment of the military-run conglomerate, Metal and Engineering Corporation (Metec), which was handed an $853m (24 billion birr) contract in 2011 (reports Reuters) to install turbines and other electrical and mechanical work under the dam’s main contractor, Italy’s Salini Impregilo.

“We have a plan to generate power from the first two units within the coming two years and then probably the dam will be completed in the year 2022,” the dam’s construction manager, Kifle Hora, told The Associated Press (AP).

He said experts were assessing equipment for possible defects, and would devise remediation plan.

Metec was fired from the project in August over delays to the M&E work, following complaints from Salini Impregilo.

In November Metec’s former director general, Major General Kinfe Dagnew, was arrested on corruption charges as he tried to flee to Sudan.

Analysts have interpreted the Ethiopian government’s moves against Metec as new Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s determination to clean up politics and balance ethnic interests.

According to The Financial Times, Metec is perceived by some as a tool of Ethiopia’s former governing elite, which had been dominated by the small Tigrayan ethnic group, represented by the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front (TPLF).

“We first noticed problems with the dam’s electro-mechanical and metal works two years ago but we only started taking detailed measurements in the past few months,” Ethiopia’s Minister of Water, Irrigation and Electricity Minister, Sileshi Bekele, told AP.

“This corporation has no prior experience and I highly doubt if some of the people have ever seen a hydropower plant. The government made a mistake in assigning a local contractor that has no knowledge and experience of such a complex project.In my opinion, it was a grave mistake and we are paying a price for that,” Kifle said.

According to official estimates, the dam is now 65% complete, AP said. It is Ethiopia’s most important project, and will transform the country’s energy profile by adding 6.4GW to its generating capacity.

It has sparked tensions with downstream Egypt, which views the dam as a threat to its water supply, but in Ethiopia GERD is a totem of national rejuvenation. Only around 43% of Ethiopia’s 100 million citizens had access to electricity in 2016, according to World Bank data.

Mass outpourings of anger and grief ensued when GERD’s chief engineer, Semegnew Bekele, was found shot dead in his car in July in the centre of the capital, Addis Ababa.

Police ruled the death as suicide, but foul play is suspected in some quarters, reports AP.

Delayed	"ASOSA, Ethiopia (Reuters) - Construction of a $4-billion dam at the heart of Ethiopia’s bid to become Africa’s biggest power exporter has been delayed five years as engineers had to replace shoddy work by a conglomerate pulled off the job last year, a project official said.

The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, announced in 2011, was designed to generate more than 6,000 megawatts in a region that struggles to produce enough energy, but has proved a lightning rod for tensions in both Ethiopia and Egypt.

“We have removed some of the steelworks on bottom outlets and replaced them with new ones,” Belachew Kassa, the site coordinator and deputy head of the project, told Reuters during a trip to the dam last week. “We also readjusted and repaired some of the steel structure works.”

He added, “The bottom outlets ... were initially done by METEC,” referring to Ethiopia’s military-industrial conglomerate that undertook much of the building work but was pulled from the project in August last year after Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed took office that April.

“Our experts found that the bottom outlets were below quality (requirements).”

A bottom outlet is an opening at a low level from a reservoir that is generally used to freely discharge water.

Controversy in Ethiopia has focused on METEC’s involvement in the project to dam the Nile, but Egypt sees the effort as an existential threat, since the river supplies nearly 90% of its fresh water for drinking, farming and industry.

Ethiopia has put the former head of METEC, Kinfe Dagnew, on trial after arresting him on corruption charges in November, along with dozens of employees.

Early this year, Ethiopia handed contracts to fulfil METEC’s work to a group of foreign companies that include Italy’s Salini Impregilo SpA, GE Hydro France, China Gezhouba Group Corp, Voith Hydro Shanghai and China’s Sinohydro Corp[SINOH.UL].

Belachew said it was unclear exactly how much METEC was to blame for delays that have put the project five years behind schedule. Although Abiy blamed METEC for problems last year, he did not say how long a delay they had caused.

The dam was initially supposed to have been finished in 2018, but an initial two turbines are now due to start generating 750 megawatts each in December 2020.

The entire dam is due to be completed by 2022, Ethiopia’s water minister, Seleshi Bekele, said last week.

Delayed	"- Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam was expected to be constructed in 5 years

Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed on Saturday blamed a military-based local contractor for the delay in construction of a multi-billion dollar dam project on the Nile.

“We have not even been able to install two turbines so far let alone complete according to timetable,” Ahmed said, in his first news conference after taking office this April.



He added that the Metal and Engineering Corporation was causing unnecessary delays in construction of the $5 billion-dollar Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) project.

Ethiopia launched the 6,000 MW project in 2011. It was scheduled to be completed within five years, but more than seven years down the line it is nowhere near complete.

He suggested that the contract could be transferred to another contractor in order to reinvigorate the project -- whose general manager Engineer Simegnew Bekele was found dead on a busy street in the capital Addis Ababa a month ago.

The prime minister’s remarks dispels doubts about the future of the dam project, which Egypt fears would reduce its “traditional share” of the Nile waters. Ethiopia maintains it needs electricity for national development.

He spoke on other pressing issues including the violence and large-scale displacement of people from Ethiopia's Somali region.

Asked about the fate of the regional state president Abdi Illey, who has been incriminated for triggering the violence, the prime minister said: “He will be brought to justice.”

The Trump administration cast the fate of the nation’s first major offshore wind farm into doubt by extending an environmental review for the $2.8 billion Vineyard Wind project off Massachusetts.

The Interior Department has ordered an additional study of the farm, proposed by Avangrid Inc. and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said in an interview with Bloomberg News Friday. The project, which has drawn opposition from fishermen and coastal communities, had been scheduled to be operational by early 2022. The developers have warned that regulatory delays could put it in jeopardy.

Bernhardt said it’s crucial the impacts be thoroughly studied. “For offshore wind to thrive on the outer continental shelf, the federal government has to dot their I’s and cross their T’s,” he said.

Avangrid sank as much as 0.9% to $50.34. It closed at $50.37 in New York.

The project south of Martha’s Vineyard is crucial to the future of offshore wind in the U.S. It’s the first of several massive wind farms planned off the East Coast. Massachusetts, New York, Maine and New Jersey are all counting on turbines at sea to achieve aggressive clean energy targets. Their efforts are expected to spur an estimated $70 billion offshore wind industry in the U.S. over the next decade.

Vineyard Wind spokesman Scott Farmelant called the Interior Department’s decision “a surprise and disappointment.”

“We urge the federal government to complete the review as quickly as possible,” he said.

Last month, Avangrid Chief Executive Officer Jim Torgerson said on a call with analysts that the project “will be challenged to move forward in its current configuration” if the final study is not issued by early September.

Vineyard Wind, which would have enough capacity to supply about 400,000 homes, has a contract to sell power to three Massachusetts utilities for $65 per megawatt-hour — a lower-than-expected price that encouraged other states to map out plans for offshore wind. That cost, however, hinged on a lucrative tax credit. The company may not be eligible to claim it if construction is delayed too long.

Marine Life

An Interior Department review explored how Vineyard Wind may affect other industries and resources, including marine life. But the National Marine Fisheries Service raised concerns it looked too narrowly at potential cumulative effects on fishing, prompting the supplemental review, Bernhardt said.

“If it’s going to be developed, it needs to be developed in a way that everyone gets to say, at least, that we didn’t shave the ball,” Bernhardt said.

Massachusetts Representative Joe Kennedy III called the delay a “double standard.”

“When it comes to drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the Trump administration has cut every corner and moved through the environmental review period at record speed,” Kennedy, a Democrat, said in an email. “But when it comes to the nation’s first major offshore wind project — which has gone through years of extensive study, public comment and mitigation plans for impacted communities — they are trying to delay it to death.”

Although the Interior Department has sold the rights to develop wind farms up and down the U.S. East Coast — and states have committed to buying the renewable power they generate — so far just one has been built: a small, 30-megawatt facility near Block Island, Rhode Island, that went online in 2016.

Revising Review

Expectations for offshore wind development are now greater than originally analyzed by the Interior Department, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said by email. The supplemental analysis will revise the agency’s assessment of the cumulative impacts of that development, the bureau said.

“There’s a lot riding on getting this right,” said Timothy Charters, vice president of government and political affairs for the National Ocean Industries Association. “It’s critically important that the department produces a decision that can give industry confidence that these projects can be permitted and will be sustained under U.S. courts.”

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Thursday a commercial airport north of Mexico City will be inaugurated by April 2022, pushing back earlier target opening dates after a slew of legal hurdles slowed work on the project.

The site of the new airport is a military base slated to be expanded into an international airport that would replace a partially built, $13 billion airport that Lopez Obrador canceled shortly after his election victory last year. At the time, he denounced the project as costly, geologically unsound and riddled with corruption.

His abrupt decision to cancel the project rattled investor confidence and sparked a sell-off in Mexican financial assets.

Speaking at an event at the Santa Lucia military base to mark the start of construction, Lopez Obrador said the project had been held back by “adversaries” who committed “legal sabotage.”"	https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-airport/mexican-president-delays-international-airport-opening-to-2022-idUSKBN1WW1UE

For its adherents, the benefits of offshore wind are self-evident: abundant, clean, emission-free power.

But for supporters of a new development off the Eastern seaboard – billed as the first utility-scale offshore wind project in the US – progress to make their vision a reality has been frustratingly unforthcoming.

In August, it was announced that Vineyard Wind – which had been scheduled to start construction off the coast of Massachusetts later this year – had been put on hold, pending a federal environmental review supported by the Interior Department.

The agency’s decision means Vineyard Wind’s original aim to construct 84 giant turbines, 14 miles off the state’s coast, able to generate enough electricity to power 400,000 homes by 2022 – now hangs in the balance.

The reason behind the Interior Department’s slow-walk is due to concerns around the project’s impact on the local fishing industry. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) claims the windfarm’s design, as it stands, would encroach on species and commercial fishing operations in the Atlantic waters.



Thus, the NMFS has informed the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), the agency responsible for offshore wind projects, that it won’t sign off on the project until it is satisfied suitable changes have been incorporated.

Having already secured contracts with Massachusetts electric utilities, the companies behind Vineyard Wind – Spanish-owned Avangrid Inc and Denmark’s Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners – are unamused by this interagency scrimmage. The developer claims the wait for an environmental permit would jeopardise the project’s timeline.

The waiting game: could Vineyard Wind be the new Cape Wind?

It is not the first time a major offshore wind project off the Massachusetts shoreline has been met with the thumbs down. Vineyard Wind is preceded by Cape Wind, which, back in 2001, promised to be the country’s first offshore wind farm, situated in Nantucket Sounds, some five miles off the coast.

However, a 16-year-long culmination of financial setbacks and political and personal opposition – local, well-heeled residents, including industrialist Bill Koch and Senator Edward Kennedy, were amongst its loudest critics – saw the project finally give up the ghost in 2017.

It’s easy to draw parallels between Vineyard Wind and Cape Wind. That said, appetite for offshore wind development in the US is much greater now than it was at the start of the millennium. The Interior Department is said to be considering auctioning more offshore wind leases to New York and California, while New Jersey has set 1200MW solicitations for next year and 2022.

Such enthusiasm, though, is yet to translate into the construction of any tangible large-scale offshore wind infrastructure. In contrast to the boom of inland turbines in recent years – the US has the world’s second largest onshore wind power capacity behind China – there is only one small offshore wind farm in the country, situated near Block Island, Rhode Island. It went online in 2016.

Build them and they will come: momentum needed to push industry forward

However, offshore wind experts believe it is only a matter of time before the industry will begin to catch up.

“Currently, eight states, from Maine to Virginia, have committed to their utilities procuring 22.5GW of offshore wind from now through to 2035,” says Stephanie McClellan, a researcher and director of the Special Initiative on Offshore Wind at the University of Delaware.

“That is equivalent to the entire global installed capacity at the end of 2018, and is just the tip of the iceberg. As the cost of offshore wind continues to fall and the US supply chain matures, the industry is set for continued market growth well beyond initial state policy commitments.”

For McClellan, once the first utility-scale projects see the light of day, others will follow in quick succession – which she likens to “a blast cap”. Liz Burdock, president of the Business Network for Offshore Wind also believes that “the US offshore wind energy market is expanding every day”, but there are caveats for growth.

“In order to keep the industry’s momentum, we need to focus on certain key issues and policies,” she says. “That means expanded training programmes to build the skilled labour force we will need, as well as greater investments in ports to support both installation and offshore wind component manufacturing.

“There also needs to be increased outreach with science-based research to the commercial fishing industry, so that offshore wind may proceed smoothly without the added cost and time delays from lawsuits.”

Beyond the White House: offshore wind power a state-driven policy

Such ardour for offshore wind does not extend to the White House. President Trump was vocal in his criticism of the European Offshore Wind Deployment Centre in Aberdeen Bay – situated close to one of his golf courses – which he accused of creating an eyesore and denting tourism.

Offshore wind also runs counter to the President’s attempt to revive fossil fuels in the US – a theme on which he campaigned during the 2016 election. However, according to Timothy Fox, a vice president with the Washington research firm ClearView Energy Partners, this hasn’t necessarily dampened wind deployment targets at state level.

“The economics of offshore wind compared to other renewable resources in the US suggest its domestic deployment may remain state-policy driven,” he says. “We also don’t think the Trump Administration opposes offshore wind, but we think it is prioritising its efforts toward other resources.

“We project East Coast states to deploy between 5,000 – 8,000MW of offshore wind by 2025, representing a significant uptick from the current deployment of 30MW.”

Getting steel in the water: can the US catch up with European wind capacity?

Nonetheless, Fox is circumspect when it comes to certain areas. He believes the BOEM’s decision to delay its permit for Vineyard Wind has “raised uncertainty and risk for project developers and their investors.” He also believes comparisons between the US and Europe – which now has a total installed offshore wind capacity of over 18,000MW – to be overly ambitious.

“European nations have experience and established supply chains for offshore wind,” he says. “They are also deploying the resource at a faster clip than the US. Offshore wind deployment here is unlikely to rival Europe soon.”

Burdock is more optimistic. In her eyes, US demand for offshore wind-generated electricity is “growing on both coasts” and “could soon surpass that of Europe”.

“We see almost limitless opportunity for the US offshore wind industry,” she says. “Offshore wind is now a global industry, and it is clear that the US pipeline of projects with secure off-take agreements is equivalent to all that Europe has installed over the past 30 years.

“We believe that the US experience in offshore oil drilling, onshore wind, big data and artificial intelligence will allow the offshore wind industry to make giant steps forward once it starts getting steel in the water here.”"	https://www.power-technology.com/features/vineyard-wind-delayed-project-reveals-bluster-in-uss-offshore-wind-ambitions/

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore’s transport minister has warned a coronavirus outbreak could cause delays to construction of multi-billion-dollar projects in the wealthy Asian city-state, such as a fifth terminal at Changi airport and the port of Tuas.

“For now, the delay to project timelines is still manageable,” Khaw Boon Wan told parliament on Thursday, the Straits Times newspaper said.

“But if the outbreak drags on, it could disrupt the supply of construction equipment and materials.”

The first of four phases of construction at Tuas port, expected to be the world’s biggest container terminal, is due to be completed in 2021, at an expected cost of about $1.8 billion.

A fifth airport terminal is expected to boost capacity by more than half when it is completed in the early 2030s. It forms part of expansion plans forecast to cost tens of billions of dollars.

Singapore has 112 cases of the virus, which originated in China and has disrupted global supply chains, clouding timelines for products and swelling manufacturing costs.

Mr Khaw told the House his ministry has been tracking the impact of the outbreak on infrastructure projects. ""For now, the delay to project timelines is still manageable,"" he said.

""But if the outbreak drags on, it could disrupt the supply of construction equipment and materials. This could impact the timeline for Terminal 5, Tuas Port, new MRT stations and the next-generation ERP system,"" he added.

New MRT lines are scheduled to be completed at various points in the next 10 years, while Changi Airport's T5 is expected to be ready in the 2030s and the Tuas Port set to be fully completed in 2040.

Mr Khaw noted that new trains for the rail network are being built in China, where the sprawling industrial sector has slowed to a crawl amid tough measures put in place to curb the spread of the coronavirus.

New trains that are manufactured in China include those for the Thomson-East Coast MRT line and the Bukit Panjang LRT network.

In the short term, the coronavirus is ""wreaking havoc around the world"", Mr Khaw said.

Within Singapore, public transport operators have been hit hard, he said during the debate on his ministry's budget.

""As fear grips, people telecommute more and go out less. Along with reduced tourist arrivals, our bus, rail, taxi and private-hire car ridership has fallen by about 20 per cent,"" he added.

Airlines have cancelled more than 20 per cent of their scheduled flights and passenger volume at Changi Airport has plunged by 25 per cent, with a further drop expected.

The cruise and ferry sectors have also been ""devastated"", said Mr Khaw.

The coronavirus Covid-19 epidemic is expected to delay the completion of Pokhara Regional International Airport in Nepal.

Pokhara Regional International Airport is under construction in Kaski District, Nepal, and will replace the existing Pokhara Airport, which was commissioned in July 1958.

The airport was originally set to open next July, however, due to the recent epidemic, project delivery might be delayed.



The $240m airport is being constructed by China CAMC Engineering, which was awarded the contract in 2014.

Last March, China CAMC Engineering completed the construction of an apron at the airport.

However, 62% of the 164 Chinese workers on the site are from Chengdu in Sichuan province.

Most of the workers returned to China for the Lunar New Year holidays in January. The employees were set to return to work by 1 February.

Due to the coronavirus epidemic, the workers are now undergoing quarantine in Sichuan before they depart for Nepal.

The company has completed around 55% of the total project work. Due to the labour shortage, the project is expected to push past the deadline.

Site manager Kevin Qin stated that they have arranged four to five rooms for the isolation of workers arriving from China for 14 days. They will be permitted to work when they do not show any symptoms.

Qin added: “We will try to bring other Chinese workers who are in Nepal’s various projects to expedite the project. We will try our best to finish the project on time.”

The publication also stated that Nepal may be ‘unprepared’ for the coronavirus outbreak. The country reportedly lacks the necessary labs, hospitals or doctors to tackle the infection and provide healthcare to patients.

Other projects in Nepal affected by the epidemic are Gautam Buddha International Airport, the Melamchi water supply project and the 756-megawatt Tamor Storage Hydroelectric Project."	https://www.airport-technology.com/news/airport-construction-nepal-delay/
Delayed	"Infrastructure projects the world over are notorious for their cost and schedule overruns, despite heavy padding of these items at the planning stage.

The construction industry is itself seriously embarrassed and has been undertaking extensive research to identify the root causes of this problem, and suggest remedial measures. Pakistan’s last two mega projects, the Islamabad Airport and the Neelum-Jhelum (NJ) project, are typical examples of this malice of cost and schedule overruns.

A Construction Industry Institute (CII), spread in fifteen US universities and with 141 leading engineering-contractor firms as its members, has undertaken comprehensive research to bring about measurable improvements in capital projects in terms of cost, schedule, quality and safety.

Some of its earlier findings were that only 25 percent of large construction projects finished on time and within budget. Further, about 65 percent of 300 global mega projects with budgets of one billion dollars or more, failed to meet the objectives established at the final investment stage. The Neelum-Jhelum Project, producing electricity at Rs15 per unit, is neither meeting the objective of cheap hydropower nor cost and time. The Islamabad Airport failed in terms of cost, schedule and ability to use dual runways for simultaneous landings and takeoffs.

But the most revealing and startling finding is that poor project design and shoddy execution are a consequence of failure to strictly comply with a set of activities very early in the project cycle. These set of activities are collectively termed by various names: pre-project planning, front-end planning, front-end loading, conceptual engineering etc.

These activities are to be carried out prior to the point of project sanction to proceed, allocation of full budget and contract notification with a major contractor. It is the period prior to commencing the detailed engineering, procurement, construction and startup or commissioning phases of the project.

Pre-project activities are divided into three sections and have a total of 70 elements. To ensure measurability, each of these elements has a score depending on its state of completeness. Cumulatively, the score of all the 70 elements is called the Project Definition Readiness Index (PDRI).

The goal of the PDRI is to determine how well the project scope of work has been defined and how well equipped and prepared the project is to commence with detailed design and construction.

According to the CII, there is a statistically significant correlation between the completeness of the PDRI and design and constructability. In other words, the quality of the PDRI determines the quality of design and project outcome. Any shortcuts or shortfalls in the pre-project planning will, therefore, be reflected in inadequate design and execution, leading to cost and schedule overruns.

If we position project management as an execution-only discipline, we will be cut-off from the really important parts of the project – those where value can be created, the pre-project planning.

The Diamer-Basha Dam with a cost outlay of Rs442 billion and eight-year completion time is of strategic importance in which delay might not be an option. But if this project is to follow through the well-defined government processes, which Neelum-Jhelum and other public-sector projects have to adhere to, then the results are a foregone conclusion.

On the contrary, it is not only possible to complete a project in less than eight years but with less than Rs400 billion also.

Unbelievable, but doable. For this to happen, we must develop and consistently apply a well-defined pre-project planning process. Religiously and thoroughly complete the 70 elements of the PDRI, before moving to design. Any shortfall at this stage will negatively affect the project objectives, cost, schedule, safety & quality, and meet the fate of previous mega projects in the country.

Earlier, Secretary Aviation Sqn Ldr (R) Muhammad Irfan Elahi had told The News on Monday that Despite non-availability of gas and some other issues beside a major water pipeline leakage, the New Islamabad International Airport is set to be operational on Friday (April 20).

A video showing huge inundated area of the airport went viral on social media on Monday night along with rumours that the inauguration of the airport has been cancelled.

Aviation secretary confirmed that formal inauguration has been moved from April 23 to May 1 without clearly spelling out the reason for the postponement. However he insisted that airport would become functional on April 20 as per the original plan.

The News, citing sources, had reported that the airport is not 100 percent ready to be operational owing to non-completion of some blocks for Airport Security Force, non-availability of fuel gas, and poor state of cleanliness. The airport cost has already crossed Rs81 billion.

They added that ASF basecamp is not complete and only blocks have been prepared so far which can accommodate 1,100 ASF personnel while the actual required ASF strength is 2,500. Currently there is no electricity and potable water available at ASF basecamp and a generator is being used to run the electronic equipment, sources said.

There are no arrangements for the residences of Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) staff. Kitchen for Pakistan International Airline is also not ready."	https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/306083-new-islamabad-airport-opening-delayed
Delayed	"TAPI pipeline project faces more delays in Afghanistan

Kabul, Jan 28 (IANS) The Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) gas pipeline project has faced another delay in Afghanistan over a postponement in land acquisition, among other issues, according to local authorities.

The Ministry of Mines and Petroleum said on Monday that some required letters have not been signed, TOLO News said in a report.

And according to the Natural Resources Monitoring Network, construction on the project will be delayed for another six months.

""There is a need for the approval of the law (on land acquisition) but there are delays because the MPs are busy in (discussing) former decrees by the President. I think it will take six months to pass this phase,"" said Ibrahim Jafarai, a member of the Natural Resources Monitoring Network.

Work on the $8 billion pipeline project began in Afghanistan in February 2018. At least 816 km of the total 1,814-km-long pipeline will pass through the provinces of Herat, Farah, Nimroz, Helmand and Kandahar in Afghanistan.

The final destination of the pipeline will be the Indian town of Fazilka, near the border with Pakistan.

When the project''s agreement was signed in 2015, the work on Afghanistan''s part was scheduled for 2017, the TOLO News report said.

Last year, the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum said work on the project will begin at the beginning of 2020.

Meanwhile, critics have said that more government focus was required on projects like TAPI and should be prioritized, because of their major impact on the Afghanistan''s economy.

Afghanistan is expected to earn more than $400 million in transit duties annually from the project.

The country will annually receive 500 million cubic metres of gas from the project in the first 10 years.

The amount will increase to one billion cubic meters of gas for the next 10 years and 1.5 billion cubic metres of gas in the third 10 years after the completion of the project.

The 800MW Vineyard Wind will not be operational in 2022, the developer of the first US large-scale offshore wind project in response to BOEM’s postponements in the permitting timeline.

According to the new timeline, the final permits for the project are expected to be issued by mid-march 2021.

BOEM was initially scheduled to release the Final Environmental Impact Statement for the project in August 2019. In July, the agency announced that the final decision on the EIS will be postponed and in August 2019 asked for a supplemental EIS to be provided. The decision on the FEIS is now scheduled for mid-December 2020.

“We have received updated information from the Department of Interior that indicates the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for the Vineyard Wind I project will be published later than what was previously anticipated,” said Lars Pedersen, CEO of Vineyard Wind.

“While we need to analyze what a longer permitting timeline will mean for beginning construction, commercial operation in 2022 is no longer expected. We look forward to the clarity that will come with a final EIS so that Vineyard Wind can deliver this project to Massachusetts and kick off the new US offshore energy industry.”

Vineyard Wind planned to begin project construction in 2019 and have the wind farm operational by 2022.

The Vineyard Wind offshore wind farm will comprise 84 MHI Vestas 9.5MW wind turbines sited approximately 14 miles south of Martha’s Vineyard and 35 miles off the coast of the Massachusetts mainland.

Vineyard Wind LLC is a joint venture between Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners and Avangrid Renewables."	https://www.offshorewind.biz/2020/02/12/first-large-scale-us-offshore-wind-farm-delayed-further/
Delayed	"Apr. 16--One of Wisconsin's first large-scale solar farms has been delayed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

Wisconsin Public Service and Madison Gas and Electric notified regulators Monday that the first phase of Badger Hollow -- a 300-megawatt solar farm in Iowa County -- will not be completed until April 2021, four months later than originally planned.

The project, which will be one of the largest solar farms in the nation, is expected to draw about 200 workers from across the country. The utilities say that won't be possible with current business and travel restrictions designed to slow the spread of the virus. In addition, they say there may not be enough housing and other resources to support the workers right now.

The utilities expect the project cost will not exceed the $389.7 million approved last year by the PSC. The budget includes the 150-megawatt Two Creeks solar farm, which is under construction between Manitowoc and Kewaunee and scheduled to come online in December.

Spokespeople for WPS and the Two Creeks developer said that project has not been delayed by the health emergency.

The pandemic is expected to affect more than a third of all U.S. power plants expected to come online in the next six months, according to the Energy Information Administration, which projects 4,900 megawatts of utility-scale generation will be canceled or indefinitely postponed while overall electricity sales are expected to fall by 3% in 2020.

The slowdown is expected to affect wind, solar and natural gas projects, though EIA economist Tyler Hodge said the agency does not have information on specific projects and there is ""a great deal of uncertainty"" around the coronavirus impact.

The one natural gas generation plant under construction in Wisconsin, Alliant Energy's 650-megawatt West Riverside Energy Center in Beloit, was scheduled to begin commercial operation in December.

The $700 million project suffered a setback late last fall when unfiltered water was accidentally used during final cleaning of the pipes that capture heat from the main turbines. According to Alliant's report to regulators, that required removal of several hundred pounds of debris and another cleanout as well as a revised air pollution permit for testing.

Alliant spokesman Scott Reigstad said with construction essentially done there were no significant impacts resulting from the coronavirus. Reigstad said the turbines are being tested now and ""if all continues to go well"" the plant could be supplying electricity by the end of April.

Alliant said it did not expect the delay to result in cost overruns.

Delayed	"CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt’s government wants to start running the nation from a new capital in the desert from mid-2020, but the $58 billion project is struggling to raise funds and needs to overcome other challenges after investors pulled out.

Workers are rushing to build core areas of the new city to replace Cairo, the existing capital on the Nile that has become a traffic-clogged, urban sprawl of more than 20 million people.

The project, launched in 2015 by Abdel Fattah al-Sisi a year after he was first elected president, aims to offer a clean and efficient base for the government and finance industry, as well as homes for at least 6.5 million people.

But the project, which also seeks to lift an economy dented by political turmoil after 2011, lost a lead investor from the United Arab Emirates and is now being run by the Housing Ministry and the army’s Engineering Authority.

“There is very strong interest from the political leadership in the project,” said Ahmed Zaki Abdeen, a retired general who heads the company building the new city, told Reuters.

But he said “the large scale of the work leads to large scale problems”, such as finding enough skilled labor to wire up the “smart city” and raising about 1 trillion Egyptian pounds ($58 billion) in financing over coming years from land sales and other investment.

“We need very extensive financing and the state doesn’t have money to give me,” said Abdeen, adding that about 20% of investment so far had come from abroad, including up to $4.5 billion from China.

A promotional video depicts a green city, running on cashless systems for transport and other services, that contrasts with Cairo, much of whose elegant 19th and early 20th century architectural heart has fallen into disrepair.

Picture taken May 2, 2019. REUTERS/Amr Abdallah Dalsh

The new city, known for now as the New Administrative Capital, is eventually expected to cover about 700 square km. The first phase, covering about 168 square km, will have ministries, residential neighborhoods, a diplomatic quarter and a financial district. A large mosque and cathedral, as well a hotel and conference center, have already been built.

With parks and tree-lined avenues, the city will consume an estimated 650,000 cubic meters a day of water from the North African nation’s scarce resources.

LAYING FOUNDATIONS

At the construction site, about 45 km (28 miles) east of Cairo, diggers and cranes clutter the landscape and wide roads run between empty plots and part-finished buildings.

Workers for China State Construction Engineering Corp (CSCEC) lay foundations for the business district, where 21 skyscrapers including Africa’s tallest at 85 stories are planned.

Abdeen said he hoped a $1.2 billion electrified train link from Cairo to the city, also being built by a Chinese firm, would be ready in 18 months. Before then the city would be served by electric buses, he said.

However, a $20 billion deal for the second project phase agreed in 2016 with China Fortune Land Development Co. Ltd fell through over financial terms. The second and third phases had been “postponed”, he added.

Despite setbacks, Egypt’s general-turned-president has been keen to show off the project, taking visiting French President Emmanuel Macron on a helicopter tour of the site in January.

David Sims, author of Egypt’s Desert Dreams, a book on development projects, said the backing of Egypt’s presidency and military made the project “too big to fail”, although he said that did not guarantee people would want to live there.

“It’s one thing to have an army of laborers and lots of machinery out there pushing dirt around but it will be another thing to see if it all comes together,” he said."	https://www.reuters.com/article/us-egypt-new-capital/egypts-new-desert-capital-faces-delays-as-it-battles-for-funds-idUSKCN1SJ10I
Delayed	"The long-overdue Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant (NPP) in Finland has been delayed again, but nuclear projects in Russia, Canada, and Iran achieved important milestones in November.

New Novovoronezh Unit Enters Commercial Operation

Rosatom announced on Nov. 1 that Unit 2 at the Novovoronezh Nuclear Power Plant II entered commercial operation 30 days ahead of schedule (Figure 1). The unit contains Rosatom’s flagship Generation III+ VVER-1200 reactor. It’s the third such unit placed in service, following Unit 1 at the site, which entered commercial operation in February 2017 and was a POWER Top Plant award winner that year, and Unit 1 at the Leningrad Nuclear Power Plant II, which went commercial in October 2018.

“Hundreds of nuclear specialists contributed to the implementation of this project. А new powerful generation source was added to the Russian energy system. We can now use this dual-unit NPP design as a reference for our foreign projects,” Alexander Lokshin, first deputy director general for operations management of Rosatom and president of ASE Group of Companies, said in a press release. “We have accumulated vast experience in construction, production organisation, procurement, supply, and finance, as well as our continuously increasing effectiveness. This is crucial to meeting modern market requirements and facing the large-scale challenges when constructing nuclear power plants,” he added.

The launch of the reactor increases the share of nuclear power in central Russia’s electricity grid to 27%. The unit has a projected lifetime of 60 years, with the possibility of an additional 20-year extension. Rosatom said many other countries, including Bangladesh, Belarus, China, Finland, and Hungary, have chosen to incorporate VVER technology into their commercial nuclear power programs, and all are in various stages of implementation.

Fuel Load Underway at Darlington Unit 2

Ontario Power Generation (OPG) reported on Nov. 12 that the refurbishment of Darlington Unit 2 remains on budget and on schedule. The company said 90% of critical work for Unit 2 was complete, and 40 of 58 major plant systems have been declared available for service.

All 960 feeder tubes have been installed on Unit 2 (Figure 2). Feeder pipes are vital to the safe operation of the nuclear reactor, because they carry the coolant required to cool nuclear fuel.

“Feeder tube installation is a complex process that has historically been a challenge on nuclear refurbishment projects around the world,” Dietmar Reiner, OPG’s senior vice president, Chief Project Officer, said in mid-September when the work was still in progress. “We’ve experienced challenges on the work series, but are making great strides in improving performance by applying lessons learned, tackling issues head-on and working collaboratively with our project partners.”

With the tubes now in place, the team is preparing to load fuel into the reactor core. OPG worked with BWXT Nuclear Energy Canada over a five-year span to develop a detailed plan for loading each of the 6,240 new fuel bundles into the core in the correct location and sequence. This work series involves the insertion of shield plugs, closure plugs, and fueling the core with fuel bundles.

Unit 2 is scheduled to return to service in the second quarter of 2020, after which, OPG plans to begin refurbishment of Unit 3. Plans and preparations continue to be developed for Darlington Units 1 and 4. The overall project was expected to take 10 years and remains on schedule for completion in 2026.

Concrete Pouring Begins on Bushehr Unit 2 in Iran

The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) held a ceremony on Nov. 10 to mark the first concrete pouring on Unit 2 of the Bushehr NPP. The concrete pouring (Figure 3) is one of the key construction milestones, marking 30% completion of the project, AEOI said.





3. Concrete pouring officially commenced at the Bushehr Unit 2 site on Nov 10, 2019. Courtesy: AEOI

The contract for Bushehr Units 2 and 3 was signed in November 2014 between owner Nuclear Power Production and Development Co. and Russian contractor Atomstroyexport Co., an affiliate of Rosatom. The contract includes the design and construction of two 1,057-MW units.

On-site work began on Unit 2 in September 2016. Since the start of construction, more than 3 million cubic meters of material have been excavated, according to AEOI. In addition, 3,000 tons of Iranian-built rebar has been installed in the Unit 2 reactor. AEOI said about 350,000 tons of cement is expected to be used (1,000 to 1,500 tons daily).

The site is also home to Bushehr 1—a 1,000-MW unit that entered commercial operation in September 2013. It is the only operational commercial nuclear reactor in the country.

Olkiluoto Schedule Under Review

Teollisuuden Voima Oyj (TVO)—owner of the Olkiluoto 3 (OL3) project—said the Areva-Siemens consortium that is supplying the plant will perform a schedule review and provide an “overall rebaseline schedule” for the final phases of the project in December. Construction on the unit began in August 2005. The plant was originally expected to commence commercial operation at the end of April 2009, but delays and cost overruns have plagued the project.

The most-recently revised schedule was released in July. It estimated nuclear fuel would be loaded into the reactor in January 2020, the first connection to the grid would take place in April 2020, and the start of regular electricity production would occur in July 2020. The latest estimates suggest the project is six weeks behind schedule.

“Although, the completion of the plant unit will be further delayed, we are very close to reach the fuel loading phase and start-up of the OL3 EPR unit. TVO is currently preparing fuel loading application,” Jouni Silvennoinen, TVO’s director of the OL3 EPR project, said in statement released Nov. 8.

As Silvennoinen noted, OL3 is based on EPR technology. The EPR is a third-generation pressurized water reactor, capable of producing about 1,650 MW of power output. Taishan Unit 1 in China was the first EPR to enter commercial operation in December 2018. It was recognized as a 2019 POWER Top Plant award winner this month.

Delayed	"ISLAMABAD: The Central Development Working Party (CDWP) on Wednesday gave go-ahead to 31 projects worth Rs713 billion.

From it eight projects costing Rs694.8 billion were referred to Executive Committee of National Economic Council (ECNEC) for review, reported Express Tribune.

The Neelum-Jhelum hydropower project originally envisioned in 1989 at a cost of Rs15.3 billion has seen its cost soar to a mammoth Rs500.3 billion under the present governments’ tenure.

Not only this makes Neelum-Jhelum hydropower project as a costly undertaking ever but also translates to its rate of electricity production costing over Rs13 per unit.

Previously, the cost of this project had been revised upwards to Rs404 billion from Rs275 billion in December 2015 by the present government.

The project has been marred by delays and the national exchequer has had to bear the brunt of these cost overruns, highlighting the government’s incompetence and inefficiency to execute projects on time.

But CDWP forwarded this project to Ecnec for its final go-ahead at a cost of Rs500.3 billion, said an official handout.

Flouting Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) ban, the CDWP gave go-ahead to over a billion rupees of projects in the constituency of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s son in law Captain (retd) Mohammad Safdar.

Closing date of collection Neelum-Jhelum surcharge was already forwarded to June 2018 by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC), said the finance ministry.

Also, CDWP gave go-ahead to the hiring of consultants at a cost of Rs100 million for third-party approval of the Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower project.

It proposed 220 KV Jauharabad substation projects at Rs3.2 billion for which ECNEC’s go-ahead has been sought.

CDWP gave go-ahead for evacuation of power from 2160MW hydropower project costing Rs75.9 billion.

Revisions in the construction design of Lahore-Sialkot motorway set to be connected with Narang Mandi and Narowal Eastern Bypass were approved by CDWP.

Faisalabad-Khanewal motorway which is 184 kilometres in length to be built at cost of Rs60.8 billion was forwarded to ECNEC for deliberation."	https://profit.pakistantoday.com.pk/2018/05/03/neelum-jhelum-project-becomes-the-worlds-most-expensive-hydel-undertaking-ever/
Delayed	"THE entrance of the new Islamabad International Airport (top) which is scheduled to open on May 3. (Bottom left) A full-body scanner. The new airport’s baggage claim section (bottom right).—White Star/Reuters

RAWALPINDI: The opening of new Islamabad International Airport on Wednesday was delayed once again but this time at the eleventh hour when the operational preparedness was complete and new flight schedule had been announced through the media.

The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said the facility would now become operational on May 3 as prime minister’s adviser on aviation Sardar Mehtab Ahmed wanted more system and equipment testing to achieve complete satisfaction.

The new airport, built at a cost of Rs105 billion, was earlier scheduled to become operational on April 20.

Airport is capable of handling nine million passengers and 50,000 tonnes of cargo every year in its first phase

Mr Ahmed expressed his satisfaction during an inspection of the airport on Wednesday, according to a spokesman for the adviser.

In pictures: New and shiny Islamabad International Airport gets final touches ahead of inauguration

“The state-of-the-art system and equipment need to be tested and trialed further to bring it to the level of international standards,” the spokesman said, adding: “Opening of the new airport was rescheduled to do more tests and trials in order to improve reliability and efficiency of systems.”

After the rescheduling announcement, a fresh Notam (notice to airmen) was issued by the CAA headquarters, saying “the airport will be operational on May 3, 2018”.

The surprising announcement of rescheduling was made at a press briefing at the new facility by Nadir Shafi Dar, CAA’s director planning, and Syed Aamir Mehmood, director media coordination of the CAA.

Briefing journalists about features and other facilities at the new airport, Mr Mehmood said the airport was capable of handling nine million passengers and 50,000 tonnes of cargo every year in its first phase. After its expansion, it would be able to serve up to 25m passengers a year by 2025, he added.

“The new airport will become the country’s hub and boost its business and economy. It is expected to provide multiple direct and indirect jobs and reap enormous economic benefits for the country,” he said, adding that the successful completion of the airport reflected the ability of the CAA to build a world class airport that had become a pride of the country.

Metro and private transport will be providing round-the-clock services for public convenience.

Mr Mehmood said it took almost 11 years to build the new airport, adding that its 190,370-square-metre four-level passenger terminal building had been designed to facilitate passengers and stakeholders.

In reply to a question about security of the airport, he said that since the new airport was located in two districts — Attock and Rawalpindi — the issue of responsibility of police security had been taken up with the Punjab home department to make a decision which city would handle the security.

Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi had last Friday paid a surprise visit to the new airport and inspected the terminal building and other facilities and sought a report on the shortcomings in two days.

The prime minister also visited the domestic arrival lounge and issued some instructions to aviation secretary Irfan Elahi after noticing some serious flaws. He inquired about the cafeteria for airport employees, including those of the Airport Security Force, CAA and airlines. He inquired about the arrangements to restrict visitors from approaching the entrance of passengers’ arrival lounge after noticing that there was no fence to prevent the visitors.

Non-availability of flight kitchen at the new airport has been a major shortcoming as the Pakistan International Airlines management has to transport thousands of meals from Benazir Bhutto International Airport’s flight kitchen to the new airport by catering trucks every day.

Delayed	"ISLAMABAD: The prime minister may not get his wish of seeing the 969MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project operational in the near future, as the project is facing an immediate financial shortfall of Rs50 billion.

“The project was expected to be completed by the end of 2016, subject to the availability and smooth dispersal of funds,” Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project managing director retired Gen Mohammad Zubair told Dawn.

He said Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had directed that the project be completed within the current year when he visited the project site in June 2013. In line with his wishes, a $68 million best effort plan was formulated and submitted to the government for speedy completion of the project at a time when it was already facing cash constraints to the tune of Rs14bn.

Also read: Neelum-Jhelum project facing financial problems

Gen Zubair said the Rs14bn was disbursed to the project after a lapse of one whole year, in June 2014. Therefore, Wapda Chairman Zafar Mahmood offered to incentivise the project acceleration plan by allowing — in November 2014 — contractors a share in project revenues ahead of schedule.

Hostile contractors, financial issues delaying work beyond end-2016 deadline

The contractors “demonstrated an inability to accelerate physical work to operationalise the project in 2015 due to time already lost,” he said, adding that the project had reached a physical stage where haste could lead to compromises on engineering codes and principles, raising the risk of a catastrophe.

The Neelum-Jhelum Hydro­power Company’s board of directors has also discussed the matter with contractors and “opined unanimously that due to immense technical intricacies and financial constraints... early completion is not possible at this point in time”.

The board was also told that the project was suffering immediate liabilities and needed the government to release Rs15bn at the earliest to expedite work. This also included Rs4.5bn in taxes and duties, up until June 30, 2015, which the Federal Board of Revenue deducts upfront and at source.

Mr Zubair said that despite being one of the most strategically crucial power projects for the country, Neelum-Jhelum Hydro­power was perhaps the only project which had reached an advanced stage without achieving financial close.

Projects usually attain financial close before they are initiated, but this one has been suffering funding problems since the very beginning. The project was originally estimated to cost Rs130bn in 2007, which went up to Rs275bn in 2012 — partly because of changes in specifications arising out of geographical changes following the devastating earthquake of 2005.

The Neelum-Jhelum project, located near Muzaffarabad in Azad Kashmir, envisages the diversion of water from the River Neelum through a tunnel underneath the River Jhelum.

He said the project had so far achieved 69 per cent physical progress, while its most crucial component — tunnel excavation — had reached 80 pc at a cost of Rs160bn so far.

He said that negotiations with Chinese banks and the Islamic Development Bank for $300m and $100m loans to meet the foreign exchange component of the project were likely to be finalised soon, but it would take at least six months before disbursement. Therefore, the government has to make available about Rs50bn, even if these are disbursed in two instalments, to ensure that the project keeps moving.

He said that Wapda authorities were also trying to arrange financing from local banks to avoid project delays. The project management had to accept certain conditions from the contractors that were not allowed under the contract and may lead to audit objections.

He said the management took the audit risks because the contractors had threatened to demobilise machinery and equipment from the site that would have cost more to re-mobilise and cost precious time.

He said the government had collected about Rs37bn under the head of Neelum-Jhelum surcharge head and another Rs22bn was expected to be raised through the surcharge, which has now been blocked due to a court order.

Delayed	"A Chinese-Filipino venture seeking to build a new international airport in the Manila Bay area has requested a fresh extension to finalize its bid due to the new coronavirus pandemic.

The consortium of Taipan Lucio Tan’s MacroAsia Corp. and state-run China Communications Construction Company Ltd. (CCCC) asked the Cavite government for another 90 days to submit its postqualification documents for the planned Sangley Point International Airport project.

ADVERTISEMENT

Jesse Grepo, secretary of the local government’s public-private partnership selection committee, said they received the request on Wednesday.

He said the letter was referred to the concerned offices “for proper action on their request, considering, among other things, the current COVID-19 crisis.”

Through its own initiative, the local government unit awarded in February the first phase of the $10-billion Sangley Point airport deal to the MacroAsia-CCCC consortium, which was the only group to bid for the project.

The submission of postqualification documents was initially due in March but this was pushed back as strict lockdown rules were imposed. An extension was given until June 11 this year, however, the consortium is again seeking more time.

An extension will delay the construction of a new air gateway in Sangley Point, which was meant to ease congestion in Manila’s Ninoy Aquino International Airport before the pandemic devastated demand for air travel.

This will also allow MacroAsa-CCCC time to adjust to the new business environment as the International Air Transport Association expects the industry to recover in the next two to three years.

The project is expected to rise on a reclaimed land on Manila Bay. The first phase involves the construction of one runway and a terminal with a capacity of 25 million passengers per year by 2023, based on the original schedule.

It will eventually expand into a four-runway airport with an annual capacity of 130 million passengers.

Delayed	"Nairobi, Kenya — ESI-AFRICA.COM — 18 March 2011 – First power from Kenya’s 300MW Lake Turkana wind project “’ the largest of its kind in Africa “’ has been pushed back slightly because of delays in obtaining the necessary government guarantees.

In January the Kenyan government finally provided letters of support from the ministry of finance, giving its backing to lenders for the 560 million euro (US$784 million) project.

“We had to hold back because of the problems we had in obtaining support guarantees from the government … and that unfortunately caused an eight-month delay,” Lake Turkana Wind Power chairman Carlo van Wageningen revealed.

He said the forecast had called for the first 50MW to be generated at the end of 2013, with full generation reached by mid-2014.

Last year the company shifted the production timeline, saying the initial 50MW would be ready by the end of 2012, delayed from an initial projected start-up date of June 2011."	https://www.esi-africa.com/top-stories/kenya-s-lake-turkana-wind-project-delayed/
Delayed	"Some big-ticket infrastructure projects are taking a backseat as the Philippine government shifts efforts to fight the spread of the COVID-19 disease.

These projects include Public-Private Partnership (PPP) deals being proposed by the private sector such as the P102-billion upgrade of Ninoy Aquino International Airport (Naia) and San Miguel Corp.’s P734-billion New Manila International Airport in Bulacan province.

“We have temporarily suspended meetings until further notice,” Ruben Reinoso, the Department of Transportation (DOTr) undersecretary for planning who oversees a number of those PPPs, told the Inquirer.

The DOTr said last week it would leave a skeleton force at its offices in Clark, Pampanga, and Mandaluyong City in Metro Manila “to only receive documents.”

“This is in adherence to the President’s directive to ensure the continuity of operations and public service within the duration of the community quarantine,” the DOTr said in a statement.

Ongoing negotiations for the upgrade of Naia will likely be pushed back, a member of Naia Consortium, the private sector group that is seeking to operate and rehabilitate Naia, said on Saturday.

Such delays indicate the significant impact COVID-19 is also having on the country’s crucial goal to upgrade infrastructure, one of the key programs of the government under its “Build, Build, Build” initiative.

To combat the spread of the virus, the administration has turned to drastic measures.

President Duterte last Thursday announced strict curbs to domestic land, air and sea travel to and from Metro Manila starting March 15 until April 14 to control the spread of COVID-19.

Even local government unit infrastructure projects with national implications are affected.

Cavite Gov. Jonvic Remulla said the China-backed consortium that won a selection process to build a P550-billion international airport in Sangley Point, Cavite, was asking for more time to finalize its members’ partnership.

“We have been in communication. They have asked for an extra month to perfect the consortium agreement,” Remulla said.

State-run China Communications Construction Co. Ltd. (CCCC) and taipan Lucio Tan’s MacroAsia Corp. were awarded a deal to develop the first phase of the Sangley Point International Airport last Feb. 14.

Remulla said he was still optimistic the project would proceed.

“We have begun soil and foundation testing for the connector bridge. We expect to begin in 12 weeks at most,” he said. INQ

Delayed	"The Brazilian government has postponed the bidding process for its BRL38bn ($16.4bn) high-speed rail project, which would link the country’s two largest cities, by at least one year.

The bidding process has been pushed back because there was only one confirmed consortium competing for the Sao Paulo-Rio de Janeiro high-speed rail project.

Brazil Transport Minister César Borges said that Spanish and German groups have guaranteed they would bid for the rail project if given more time.

""It’s better to have a competitive process with the greatest number of bidders possible,"" Borges said.

According to analysts, the government preferred not to open itself to further criticism by awarding the rail project to the one bidder, as in June 2013 it faced massive protests against corruption and misuse of public money.



The only consortium ready to take part in the competition was comprised of French companies Alstom and SNCF Group.

Companies such as Germany’s Siemens, Spanish firms Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles (CAF) and Renfe have also showed interest in the project, according to Borges.

""Spanish and German groups have guaranteed they would bid for the rail project if given more time.""

Brazil has already cancelled the previous tendering process in 2011 as there were no bids for the project.

According to reports, a Spanish consortium comprising Renfe and Talgo has asked for postponement of the process, to offer bids for the project.

The delay would also give French, Spanish and German groups time to better analyse the project and help in securing more bids from Japanese, Chinese and South Korean firms.

Despite the further delay, the government still expects to complete and start operations on the high-speed rail line by 2020.

Once operational, trains are planned to travel at speeds of around 350kmph between Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, completing the journey in under two hours

In the first year of operation, the high-speed rail link is estimated to carry 40 million passengers, with demand expected to increase to about 100 million by the end of the concession in 2060."	https://www.railway-technology.com/news/newsbrazil-delays-bids-high-speed-train-project
Delayed	"The government of Morocco has postponed the completion date for its port at the city of Safi, on the country’s Atlantic coast.

The city is building the port to handle coal imports for a $2.6bn, 1.4GW thermal power plant, which was completed in December last year.

The port, which was begun in April 2013, was to have been complete at the end of July. However, a series of problems arose during construction, including the cracking of 700 blocks of concrete in 2017, which meant that a dock that was to be used to unload coal carriers had to be reconstructed.

The problems with the project are thought to have cost the government in the region of £50m.

Work on the power plant, undertaken by French energy company Engie, was completed in December by Daewoo Engineering and Construction. It also ran into trouble when equipment to heat water was found to be faulty, leading to a loss for Daewoo of about $300m.

Operation of the power station requires the import of 10,000 tonnes of coal daily

Delayed	"Colombia's troubled Túnel de la Línea road project has again been postponed amid restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The government said the latest setback is due to quarantine measures that have limited access to materials and labor.

Considered Colombia's most important road initiative, El Túnel de la Línea cuts through the Cordillera Central mountain range from Cajamarca in Tolima department to Calarcá in Quindío.

The 30km project includes a series of 24 bridges and 20 tunnels, the largest of which spans 8.7km at around 2,500m above sea level.

Originally scheduled for completion in 2013 at a cost of 650bn pesos, the Túnel de la Línea is now estimated to require total investments of around 3.5tn pesos (US$900mn). Officials did not provide a new timeframe for its conclusion but ruled out previous plans to meet a May deadline.

""The reactivation will only be carried out under strict compliance with safety protocols. We are implementing the necessary protection and prevention measures so that part of the staff can return to the site and thus mitigate the risk of contagion among the staff,” said Juan Esteban Gil, the director of national roads institute Invías.

According to the government agency, the project's civil works were completed in February. The remaining work involves the installation of electro-mechanic equipment, which is around 60% complete.

Companies involved in the project's construction include Conconcreto and CSS Constructores, OHL, Alca Ingeniería, Hidalgo e Hidalgo, Concay, Disico, Comsa and Ingeniería Telematica Gyc, among others."	https://www.bnamericas.com/en/news/colombia-delays-us900mn-tunnel-project
Delayed	"(Reuters) - Sempra Energy (SRE.N) on Monday said it was delaying a decision to go ahead with a large LNG export project in Texas until 2021, as the coronavirus pandemic cuts global demand for energy.

Energy firms around the world have pushed back decisions on liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals and other infrastructure projects as global demand for energy has collapsed due to the coronavirus outbreak. Investment demand in LNG has been running high for several years due to heavier consumption from mostly Asian countries diversifying their generation mix away from coal.

The growth rate for LNG use is slowing now, however, and that could cause numerous planned projects to be put on the backburner for some time.

At the start of 2020, about a dozen North American developers said they planned to make final investment decisions on whether to go ahead with new projects by year-end. Some of those projects were delayed from 2019. Now, about half of this year’s slate have been pushed into next year, and analysts said they expect few projects to go ahead in 2020.

One still slated to move forward is Sempra’s Costa Azul LNG export plant in Mexico. The company said it expects to make a final investment decision (FID) on that plant in the second quarter, subject to export permits. The new export facility at its existing Costa Azul LNG import plant, which entered service in 2008.

Sempra said it earned $2.53 per share in the first quarter. It had said that it was targeting a FID on the proposed Port Arthur LNG export plant in Texas in the third quarter.

Sempra said Costa Azul LNG signed 20-year agreements with units of Total SA (TOTF.PA) and Mitsui & Co (8031.T) for about 2.5 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) or 0.33 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of natural gas.

Sempra has said Port Arthur LNG is in talks with units of Saudi Aramco (2222.SE) to buy 5 MTPA of LNG and invest 25% equity, and with Polish Oil & Gas Co (PGNiG) (PGN.WA) to buy 2 MTPA. The initial phase of that project is designed to export about 11 MTPA of LNG.

The energy industry has a long history of delaying decisions on multi-billion dollar LNG projects. By the middle of the decade, however, Sempra said new LNG infrastructure will be needed to support increasing demand.

Shares of Sempra stock were up about 5% to $125.35 in afternoon trade on Monday."	https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sempra-usa-results/sempra-delays-big-texas-lng-project-as-global-energy-demand-slumps-idUSKBN22G1IS
Delayed	"BOGOTA (Reuters) - The start of work on Colombian capital Bogota’s first metro line could be delayed by at least six months because companies involved in its construction are affected by quarantine orders to control the spread of the coronavirus, officials said Monday.

Construction will be delayed if an independent controller - who will audit contract awards - is not appointed.

The Bogota Metro Company (EMB) has extended the deadline for six international consortia to submit their bids to be the project’s independent controller to May 27, from April 14 previously.

“The decision (to extend the deadline) was taken due to operating and travel restrictions in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic,” the EMB said in a statement.

The different consortia include companies from Spain, Germany, the United States, Mexico and Brazil.

The contract for building the first metro line in Bogota, which will cost some 13.8 trillion pesos ($3.55 billion) was awarded last October to the Apca Transmimetro consortium, which is led by Chinese companies Harbour Engineering Company Ltd.(CHEC) and Xi’an Metro Co. Ltd.

EMB manager Andrés Escobar explained that work to build the metro cannot begin without an auditor.

“If the tender to select the independent controller is unsuccessful, another tender would have to be held and the start of works would be delayed for at least six months,” Escobar said in a statement.

The metro, which has been fought over by politicians for years, is considered a crucial project in reduce Bogota’s chaotic traffic. The city has more than 7 million inhabitants and the metro will complement the TransMilenio bus system.

Bogota Mayor Claudia Lopez previously estimated that the first metro line will be ready in 2028.

Delayed	"The start of work on the Bogotá metro could be delayed by more than six months as the companies competing to manage it are affected by coronavirus quarantine orders, Reuters reported yesterday.

The Bogotá Metro Company has extended the deadline for six international consortiums to submit their bids to be the project’s auditor to 27 May from 14 April, but if that tender process hits problems, the whole scheme could be pushed back.

The decision was prompted by operating and travel restrictions in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic, the EMB said in a statement.

EMB manager Andrés Escobar said work could not begin until an auditor was appointed. “If the tender to select the independent controller is unsuccessful, another tender would have to be held and the start of works would be delayed for at least six months,” he said.

The project was awarded last October to the Apca Transmimetro consortium, led by Chinese companies Harbour Engineering Company and Xi’an Metro, which will also run the system for the next 25 years.

The project is in the pre-construction phase, with work on site expected to begin in the second quarter of 2020 and be complete towards the end of 2025.

The elevated line will be the first in Bogotá, a city of some 8 million people that at present relies on a bus rapid transit network, which opened in 2000.

The idea for a metro was first proposed in 1967. This latest version is expected to cost around $4.3bn, with $480m of that coming from a loan from the European Investment Bank.

Delayed	"The coronavirus outbreak is having significant negative effects on hydropower project development in many Asian countries, including Bangladesh, Nepal and Indonesia. Projects are coming to a halt, and many could be facing delayed completion dates as a result.

According to the Ministry of Electricity and Energy, in Myanmar, projects such as the construction of a 151-MW hydropower plant in Ahlon Township, Yangon, are to be delayed. Timely development will likely not occur due to the closing of factories and the travel ban to countries like Myanmar, where the operation is located.

Work at the China-backed 510-MW Batang Toru hydropower plant on Indonesia’s Sumatra Island has come to a halt as well.

It is rumored that many Chinese workers who left construction sites to return to their homes for Chinese New Year now cannot travel back due to the travel ban, leaving many hydropower projects understaffed. AFP, a global news agency, states that Nepal is being directly affected by the lack of returning employees, as the country is home to many Chinese-backed hydropower projects.

“In their absence, projects are being delayed or slowed down,” said Vishnu Bahadur Singh from the Nepal Hydropower Association. “Many of them are in specialized work, and it is not easy to replace them locally.”

The Himalayan Times concludes that construction of the 400-kV Dhalkebar substation, 111-MW Rasuwagadhi Hydropower Project, 140-MW Tanahu Hydropower Project and 37-MW Upper Trishuli 3B Project have been affected by the coronavirus as well. This list is just a few of many projects in Nepal that continue to be affected by this outbreak.

Rasuwagadhi Hydropower Co., developer of the Rasuwagadhi Hydropower Project, has already submitted a letter seeking “force majeure” for the construction works. Engineering News-Record reported that a full emergency halt will take place for the endeavor if conditions do not improve.

“Depending on how the situation pans out, completion date of projects could be pushed back by at least six months to one-and-a-half years,” as per The Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) officials.

Other affected projects in Nepal include the 756-MW Tamor Storage Hydroelectric Project in the country’s eastern provinces and a 400-kV substation for the $99-million, 179-mile Hetauda-Dhalkebar-Duhabi transmission line.

KATHMANDU, Nov. 18 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli on Monday inaugurated a China-funded 60MW Hydropower Project which had started producing electricity recently.

Upper Trishuli 3A Hydropower Project, developed by Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA), the state-owned power production and utility body, and constructed by China Gezhouba Group Company, is located at the border of Rasuwa and Nuwakot districts in the central region.

Prime Minister Oli hit the switch to inaugurate the project from his office at Singh Durbar, Kathmandu as he watched the project site through video along government officials.

During the inauguration, Prime Minister Oli said that the project would help to reduce electricity import from India and promote industrialization and modernization of agriculture by increasing the use of electricity. ""We will strengthen our economy by completing similar other under-construction projects.""

According to NEA, Nepal's average demand of electricity is around 1300MW and the country has been importing around 500MW electricity from India.

The NEA said that the Upper Trishuli 3A project will run in full capacity for eight months in a year and it will produce 45MW even in the remaining four months. ""It will fulfill the seven percent of total electricity demand of the country,"" Phanindraraj Joshi, chief of the project, told Xinhua on Monday.

The NEA developed the project with concessional loan of around 116 million U.S. dollar from China Exim Bank along with its some domestic resources. Total project cost stood at 125 million U.S. dollar, according to NEA. Nepal should repay the loan to China Exim Bank in 25 years including a grace period of five year.

""It is also the first project in Nepal which was contracted under Engineering Procurement Construction Modality,"" said Joshi.

The NEA had signed contract with China Gezhouba Group Company in May 2010 to develop the project.

Although the project was supposed to be completed by May, 2014, factors like dispute over whether to build power house underground or over ground and whether to increase the capacity of the project, delayed the completion of the project initially.

Following the earthquake in Nepal in April 2015, the work in the project was delayed further as access roads to the project sites were badly damaged by landslides caused by the quake."	http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-11/18/c_138564821.htm
Delayed	"The government of Seychelles has confirmed that the construction of a floating solar PV power plant will be delayed due to consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Seychelles announced its plan to install a utility-scale floating solar PV system, the first in Africa, in April 2018. Construction of the system which will be located on the lagoon at Le Rocher, in the central Mahe district of Les Mamelles, was due to start this year.

Seychelles

Speaking to Seychelles News Agency, the chief executive of the Seychelles Energy Commission, Tony Imaduwa, said due to the COVID-19 situation issuance of the notice of intended award was delayed as the selected bidder will not be able to meet all the conditions set.

Imaduwa said that some of the conditions required the bidder to be in the country to finalise the technical design of the plant. However, this has not taken place because of the travel restrictions to Seychelles.

He said now that the notice of intended award has been issued, the successful bidder Quadran will have around five months to meet the conditions set before construction can start.

“It is a crucial stage of the process. Maybe there will be some cost implications but the project is based on an Independent Power Producer (IPP) model where the IPP will have to finance, design, construct and operate the plant and sell electricity at a fixed rate over a period of time,” Imaduwa explained.

The project is Seychelles’ first independent power producer, meaning the private sector will be responsible for designing, financing, building, and operating the power plant, as well as selling electricity to the national grid at a predetermined price for 25 years.

Utility-scale floating solar plant

Quadran was selected from a competitive process based on the lowest rate to sell electricity generated from the PV plant to the local Public Utilities Corporation which is $9.5 cents.

The power purchase agreement is scheduled to be signed in the next few months and the construction starting soon after.

Once installed and running, the utility-scale floating solar PV system is expected to contribute around 5.8GWh annually. This will contribute to a reduction in fossil fuel importation which translates to savings in foreign exchange for the country.

The energy from the new project is also expected to equate to 1.6% of the Seychelles’ energy target set for 2030.

Imaduwa said the system “is an innovative way of addressing our land constraint and demonstrates the country’s commitment to combat climate change.”"	https://www.esi-africa.com/industry-sectors/renewable-energy/seychelles-delays-planned-floating-solar-plant-due-to-covid-19/
Delayed	"Hybrid solar-wind-battery complex in Australia facing more delays

November 12 (Renewables Now) - The Kennedy Energy Park (KEP) in North Queensland, which combines wind, solar and energy storage technologies, is unlikely to reach full commercial operations in the next four to five months even though it has been fully installed and energised.

This is according to a forecast by the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractor, a joint venture between Vestas Wind Systems A/S (CPH:VWS) and Quanta Services Inc (NYSE:PWR).

Windlab Ltd (ASX:WND), one of the two companies behind the Kennedy Energy Park project, said in an update on Tuesday that the EPC contractor has failed to deliver in time a fully functioning, compliant generator performance standard (GPS) model and electrical plant meeting the network standards. This has so far prevented the registration of the project as a generator, which is key for launching full commercial operation.

The Kennedy complex combines 43.2 MW of wind, 15 MW of solar and 2 MW/4 MWh of Tesla battery storage capacity. It started generating limited volumes of power in August 2019.

The project developers, Australian Windlab and Japanese firm Eurus Energy Holdings Corp, earlier this year sought liquidated damages from the contractor, which disputed these and in turn requested certain milestone payments. The dispute has now escalated to a security of payment adjudication. The Kennedy developers have until November 26 to respond to the EPC contractor’s submission to the adjudicator.

“Windlab believes that Kennedy Energy Park has recourse under the terms of the EPC contract for these ongoing delays and costs if substantive legal proceedings become necessary,” Windlab said.

According to the update, the original construction and commissioning programme for the project is already 13 months behind schedule."	https://renewablesnow.com/news/hybrid-solar-wind-battery-complex-in-australia-facing-more-delays-675979/
Delayed	"Plans to build the $12 billion Inga 3 hydropower project may be finally coming to fruition after a new energy treaty signed by South Africa and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) promised to give the long-stalled project a credible power purchaser.

The DRC has been seeking a development group for the 4.8-GW project proposed on the Congo River—the third largest river in the world by volume of water discharged—and bidders have apparently been forthcoming. So far bid groups for the projects include China Three Gorges Corp. and Sinohydro Corp; a consortium of South Korean companies POSCO and Daewoo Corp. and Canada’s SNC-Lavalin Group; and Spain’s Actividades de Construccion y Servicios SA and Eurofinsa Group. But the DRC is still open to other investors and has said it could make its decision in June or July next year.

That means construction of Inga 3, which would be the first of eight massive units comprising the ambitious 40-GW Grand Inga project, may begin in October 2015 and be completed by 2020. That $80 billion project would require 66 square miles around the Congo River to be flooded to create what could become the largest source of hydropower in the world.

Two existing dams—Inga 1 and Inga 2 (Figure 2)—have already been operating on the Congo River for more than three decades, but they are dilapidated and underperform at around 50% of capacity. Internationally backed efforts to refurbish those plants are underway, but even these more modest projects have been plagued by years of delay. By June 2013, three out of six turbines in Inga I had been rehabilitated and one had been replaced. The other two turbines were scheduled for completion by the end of 2013. Five of Inga 2’s eight turbines were working, and the other three are scheduled to be refurbished by the end of 2015.

While feasibility studies for the Inga 3 project have been carried out (financed by the African Development Bank), no power purchasers emerged until the DRC’s October treaty with South Africa, which guarantees 2,500 MW from the project for South Africa’s power-strapped state-owned utility Eskom. Under the treaty, the DRC will build nearly 1,841 kilometers (km) of transmission lines to its border with Zambia, and South Africa will install 1,540 km of lines from Zambia through Zimbabwe. The DRC has meanwhile said it will provide 1,300 MW from Inga 3 to the country’s lucrative but energy-short copper mining industries in Katanga province. The remainder is expected to power the DRC. Of the country’s population of 70 million, only 9% have electricity.

Observers still express reservations about the project’s completion, however, owing to the DRC’s political volatility. The country is emerging from a long period of conflict and mismanagement, though in 2011—for the first time in more than four decades—it was able to organize back-to-back multiparty presidential and parliamentary elections.

Then there are cost concerns: Estimates to refurbish the Inga 1 and Inga 2 projects alone were recently expanded from $226.7 million to $460.2 million. Meanwhile, the World Bank is reviewing an aid request from the DRC’s Ministry of Energy for $73 million of the Inga 3’s $12 billion total project cost. It optimistically says in affiliated documents that the hydropower potential of the 40-GW Inga project would make it the largest and “most cost-effective” hydroelectric site in the world. And though it notes that “heavy engagement” in the electricity sector through two regional energy projects yielded “limited results,” significant progress has been made in recent months on the institutional front, including strengthening governance within the DRC’s National Electricity Co.

Delayed	"Global Coal Plant Tracker shows project pipeline shrinking by 25%

The latest data from the Global Coal Plant Tracker (GCPT) shows that India’s coal-fired pre-construction project pipeline has shrunk by a quarter, that is 24 GW in the last six months alone. India’s thermal power giant NTPC Ltd has reportedly shelved 10.5 GW of its planned coal-fired power projects year-to-date. Project cancellations are coming faster as financial viability remains dubious and India increases its low-cost renewable installations.

India’s National Electricity Plan (NEP) 2018 assumes 94 GW of new coal-fired capacity will be added between 2017/18 and 2026/27. With the renewables program accelerating, IEEFA views this as too high an estimate if UDAY is successful in bringing AT&C losses down. Further, IEEFA believes that many of these project proposals, based on outdated subcritical technology, will become stranded assets even before they are built, resulting in a waste of land, capital, and political effort.

THE COAL-FIRED POWER SECTOR ALSO ACCOUNTS FOR A SIGNIFICANT SHARE OF NON-PERFORMING ASSETS (NPAs) THAT CONTINUE TO TROUBLE THE INDIAN BANKING SECTOR. The government estimates there are about 40.1 GW of stranded coal-fired power projects, of which 15.7 GW are not even commissioned.

Earlier this year, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Energy report highlighted issues responsible for the financial stress in India’s coal-fired sector. An absence of coal supply contracts due to the cancellation of assigned coal blocks, poor locations distant from coal sources, use of outdated imported equipment, lack of long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) and delays in land acquisition resulting in cost overruns were some of the key issues identified by the committee.

Some of these projects had signed PPAs at aggressively low tariffs that make debt servicing difficult. In the meantime, variable cost related to coal-fired generation has gone up due to increases in coal prices (particularly for coastal plants suffering from a doubling in import coal prices) as well as the cost of freight charges for coal transportation.

As per India’s Central Electricity Authority (CEA) estimates, the tariff for a new emission controls compliant pit-head supercritical coal-fired power plant should be Rs4.39/kWh (for a PLF of 60%). With super competitive renewable energy PPAs with zero indexation now regularly priced in the Rs2.50-3.00/kWh range, new coal power plants are struggling for viability across India.

India’s coal-fired power sector woes reflect the combination of excessive financial leverage, operational inefficiencies and competition arising from accelerated deflation in renewable energy tariffs, all of which make investors sceptical of the sector. India’s financial sector is ill-equipped to force promoters to write-off their equity investment in stranded assets, resulting in delays and ultimately bigger losses to debt providers, given interest expense continues to accrue on long stalled projects.

While coal sector lenders are trying to restructure and resolve some US$40 bn in stranded assets,[i] an accelerating number of developers are walking away from their planned but now long stranded coal power plans.

NTPC Ltd has displayed prudence by deciding to turn away from a growing number of stalled coal-fired power project proposals that have not moved in years in the wake of record low coal utilisation rates and rising demand for cheaper renewables.

In June 2018, NTPC decided to drop its 4 GW greenfield coal-fired Pudimadaka Ultra Mega Power Project. The plant was planned in 2011 with a PPA signed with the government of Andhra Pradesh. The project over the years had several failed attempts to organise a domestic coal linkage and even was denied a captive port to handle imported coal by the Ministry of Defence when it pursued that option.

July 2018 saw NTPC confirm it has no intention to pursue two other planned coal power plant developments – the 1,980 MW Nabinagar-2 and 1,600 MW Katwa thermal power generating units in Bihar and West Bengal, respectively. The plants originally had arranged PPAs with multiple states including West Bengal, Jharkhand, Odisha, Sikkim and Bihar. Odisha’s energy minister had requested to cancel the PPA with Nabinagar Plant as the lower cost of renewables and the move to power surplus meant demand growth was insufficient to justify these expansions.

NTPC in February 2018 shelved the 1,600 MW expansion of Kaniha stage 3 Unit 1&2 in Talcher, Odisha on the back of surplus generation capacity in the state and the shift to renewable generation across the country. GCPT also put NTPC’s 1,320 MW Simhadri power plant in Andhra Pradesh in the shelved category this year, as the project has not received any required permits.

This is not to say NTPC is abandoning coal power generation any time soon. NTPC has 47 GW of existing coal generation and it has been selectively acquiring equity stakes in financially distressed state coal power plants such as the Nabinagar Power Generating Company and Kanti Bijlee Utpadan Nigam Limited in Bihar in June 2018.

NTPC started 2017/18 with a development pipeline of 25 GW of new coal plants. Shelving 10.5 GW since February 2018 represents a dramatic recognition of the dynamic state of the Indian electricity sector and size of the disruption from renewables. But it is not the end of thermal coal, not least given Indian thermal power plants have an average 25-40 year lifespan and the majority were only commissioned in the last decade.

India’s remarkably ambitious renewables investment program should be sufficient to accommodate almost all the incremental electricity demand growth that will result from 6-8% annual GDP (net of energy efficiency, grid efficiency plus nuclear and hydropower additions).

With the National Electricity Plan (NEP) 2018 showing 48 GW of planned end of life coal plant closures by 2027/28, India likely will need some additional coal power to offset those closures. However, this does not mean new coal plants are necessarily needed to fill the gap – the record low coal plant utilisation rates of just 57.4% in 2017/18 provide scope for 20-30% more generation via better utilisation of existing assets.

Slower than expected electricity demand growth has given states reason to avoid signing long-term PPAs to avoid paying extravagant capacity charges even if the plants are not generating power, particularly in the knowledge that medium term renewable energy tariffs are likely to be materially lower.

The effect of surplus capacity, slowing demand, increased coal input costs and competition with cheaper renewable sources has left coal-fired power project development languishing in India.

GCPT data reports that 573 GW of coal-fired power projects in India has been cancelled or shelved between 2010 and June 2018. GCPT deems a project as cancelled if there is no development progress on the project for four years and shelved after two years. Projects vanishing from company documents is another sign of companies quietly walking away from the projects.

With 39 GW already under construction, much of the 63 GW in planned capacity in various stages of pre-construction development will simply add to existing surplus capacity, increasing distressed assets. In such a situation, the generation facilities will compete within the coal-fired sector and result in sustained sub-optimal capacity utilisation rates.

As per CEA’s reporting, out of the last five quarters, three quarters have seen net negative additions of coal-fired power capacity as 2.6 GW of capacity was retired in this 15-month period.[ii] Plant retirements projected in the NEP seem to be coming along as planned.

For states without their own in-state coal mining capacity, relying on expensive interstate or imported coal-fired power is increasingly a money losing option that threatens affordable energy security and slows distribution company reforms.

NTPC has been judicious in cancelling surplus planned projects and reducing its stranded asset risks. This represents a clear example for investors in terms of a sustainable transition to progressively pivot toward lower cost, lower emissions electricity generation, jettisoning the drag of now surplus, expensive coal-fired project proposals that have been stalled for years.

Delayed	"Floating solar project schedule in Seychelles hit by COVID-19 - report

June 30 (Renewables Now) - The construction of a 5-MW floating solar array in Seychelles will be postponed due to the travel restrictions imposed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Seychelles News Agency (SNA) reports.

Tony Imaduwa, CEO of the Seychelles Energy Commission, told SNA that the reason is the delayed issuance of the notice of intended award to the selected bidder. The tender for the project, launched in 2018, was won by a local unit of Quadran International, now Qair, and Seychelles solar company VetiverTech.

Qair said in March it aimed to start installation in July. According to Imaduwa, the start of construction, initially planned for 2020, will be delayed by several months to ensure that the selected bidder has enough time to meet all conditions. For some, related to the technical design of the power plant, physical presence was required but was not possible due to the travel restrictions aimed at limiting the spread of the coronavirus.

The Commission’s CEO suggested that the independent power producer (IPP) may face some cost implications because of the delay.

Located on the lagoon of Providence on Mahe island, the project will create what will be the world's biggest seawater floating solar system. An off-take deal for the 5.8 GWh of electricity per year is due to be signed in the next few months."	https://renewablesnow.com/news/floating-solar-project-schedule-in-seychelles-hit-by-covid-19-report-704565/
